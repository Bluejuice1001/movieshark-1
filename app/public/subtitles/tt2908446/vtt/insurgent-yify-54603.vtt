1
00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:02.716
Peace.

2
00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:05.117
Long ago,

3
00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:08.376
before the founders established
this great city of ours

4
00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:13.583
that word was all but meaningless,
an ideal as elusive as a dream.

5
00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:16.632
Now, 200 years later.

6
00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.561
We are all of us living proof
that peace is indeed attainable.

7
00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.518
The reason for this is of
course are faction system.

8
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:30.658
Erudite, Dauntless,
Amity, Candor, Abnegation.

9
00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:34.396
In dividing people according
to personality and attitude

10
00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:38.824
we've created a society in which
each faction plays a critical role

11
00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:40.382
in maintaining the social order.

12
00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:43.971
But this harmony we achieved
is now under attack from

13
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:47.321
a small but extremely dangerous
group of individuals.

14
00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:50.434
We call them "Divergents".

15
00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:54.765
They are in essence the worst
of what humanity used to be

16
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:58.982
rebellious, defiant, and uncontrollable.

17
00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:03.190
Five days ago, a rogue
group of divergents

18
00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:06.945
posing as Dauntless brutely
invaded Abnegation

19
00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:08.847
in an obvious attempt
to cripple the faction

20
00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:10.982
system by attacking it's
most vulnerable members.

21
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:18.390
These divergents despise our system because
they are incapable of conforming to it.

22
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.261
These latest rumours for example that I was
somehow behind the attack on abnegation

23
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.190
is nothing more that divergent propaganda.

24
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.164
I have devoted myself to bringing
these fugitives to justice.

25
00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.931
I've exercised my right as acting
council leader to declare martial law

26
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.817
until im confident that any threat
to our security has been eliminated.

27
00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:42.210
Tell Jeanine we got it.

28
00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.313
We are all that's left of humanity.

29
00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:49.136
The vast wall that encloses this city

30
00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:53.270
may protect us from our toxic surroundings,

31
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.757
but it is up to us to confront any element
that can poison us from within.

32
00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:03.010
Because when you are civilizations
last hope peace is not merely an ideal

33
00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:05.267
its an obligation.

34
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:10.023
And it is up to all us to take a stand
position against it's one true enemy.

35
00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:12.672
Divergents.

36
00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.764
Amity!

37
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.786
We should make sure it's clear.

38
00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:53.262
Tris!

39
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:13.059
Help us, help us, please!

40
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.440
Please help us,
you have to help us!

41
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.293
I'm sorry, you have to leave.

42
00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:23.982
- You just don't belong here.
- It's all her fault.

43
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.615
You killed Will.

44
00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.721
No...

45
00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:35.589
She killed...

46
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:46.182
Mom!

47
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.217
You've killed us all.

48
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.130
- And... Three!
- Higher!

49
00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:55.970
Higher, higher!
- Are you alright?

50
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.187
Okay everyone back to you classroom

51
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.013
I just wanted to do something different.

52
00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:17.900
Yeah.

53
00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.115
Well that's definitely different.

54
00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:37.693
- You dont like it?
- No, I like it, I like it alot

55
00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:40.497
I'm just surprised, that's all.

56
00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:46.450
- What's going on, Tris?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

57
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.382
Just...

58
00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:51.931
Still having nightmares?

59
00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:55.644
No.

60
00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:02.857
We're good.

61
00:08:04.712 --> 00:08:09.012
You and me. I know nothing
else is, but we are.

62
00:08:15.648 --> 00:08:17.178
Time for chores.

63
00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:35.076
How much longer do we
have to stay here, Four?

64
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:36.760
Until we know it's
safe to leave.

65
00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:09.906
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:12.024
Son!

67
00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:16.852
You can't ignore me forever.

68
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:22.393
I know you're thinking about your next
move, but there are things you don't know.

69
00:09:22.593 --> 00:09:24.533
Marcus, please just leave us alone.

70
00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:29.093
Your mother didn't come back to
abnegation just to save you.

71
00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.093
She died trying to hide
something from Jeanine

72
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.596
that something entrusted
to Abnegation

73
00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.383
- long time ago.
- Marcus! Stop!

74
00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.053
Whatever you want from us,
you're not gonna get it.

75
00:09:41.044 --> 00:09:43.092
I'm not the enemy here.

76
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.490
You found it...

77
00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:04.140
It was in the home of Natalie
and Andrew Prior, like you said.

78
00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:13.777
Want to tell me what's inside?

79
00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:18.491
A message from the founders that will
ensure the future of people who deserve it.

80
00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:28.168
Divergents will destroy our society,
unless we destroy them.

81
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.614
And now we can.

82
00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:38.920
However, only a divergent
can open this box.

83
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.633
Find them!

84
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.398
Every last one of them.

85
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.248
Go with happiness.

86
00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.431
Go with happiness.

87
00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.346
- You with happiness.
- Thank you.

88
00:11:18.548 --> 00:11:20.246
Go with happiness.

89
00:11:21.926 --> 00:11:25.000
I really don't know how much longer I
can do this whole peace and love thing.

90
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:27.552
It's the amity way, just try to blend in.

91
00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:29.711
I'm trying to blend in,

92
00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:31.520
and its just not working.

93
00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:34.220
- Coming through, on you right.
Hey here we go.

94
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.647
Look a rainbow. It's pretty.

95
00:11:37.912 --> 00:11:41.259
Pathological offendiness along without
questioning passivity. I love this place.

96
00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:43.725
Thank you. Go with happiness.

97
00:11:43.925 --> 00:11:47.394
- Oops, Excuse me.
- Hey tris, I really like your hair by the way.

98
00:11:47.595 --> 00:11:49.356
Did you try to cut it
all short and weird...

99
00:11:49.556 --> 00:11:52.061
Hey Peter, why don't you take
your food and sit down huh?

100
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:53.423
Or what?

101
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:58.573
Besides I think we all should stick together
now that we are officially fugitives.

102
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.186
Wait what do you mean
by official fugitives?

103
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.503
You don't know? You
did'nt tell Caleb?

104
00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:06.686
Yesterday Jeanine announced that
the attack on Abnegation

105
00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:10.667
was organized by a group of
regenade divergents And their sympathizers.

106
00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:12.463
So they're blaming
this whole thing on us?

107
00:12:12.488 --> 00:12:13.019
Yeah.

108
00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:15.322
And Jeanine needed a
reason to petition to the

109
00:12:15.347 --> 00:12:17.103
council so they could
institute martial law.

110
00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.095
And now she had one.

111
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.521
Staying here at Amity is

112
00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:30.848
the best option for now.

113
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.178
We need to keep an eye
of the ground and find

114
00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:34.763
out where the rest of
the dauntless are.

115
00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:39.113
- Then we can make a move.
- We need to kill Jeanine.

116
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:43.697
I know, we're not ready yet.

117
00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:52.317
- Beatrice you're not being serious, right?
- No I am being serious..

118
00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:55.619
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.

119
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.261
Tris you can't just go
around killing people.

120
00:12:58.286 --> 00:12:59.932
She's right, listen
to your sister.

121
00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:01.770
Tris, I think you should go to

122
00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:03.732
erudite and kill
Jeanine yourself.

123
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.317
I will stay with Caleb so

124
00:13:05.342 --> 00:13:06.507
they don't kill him too.

125
00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:11.282
What?

126
00:13:12.453 --> 00:13:13.879
C'mon you know.

127
00:13:15.073 --> 00:13:16.680
What you did with your parents.

128
00:13:33.522 --> 00:13:34.824
Stop!!!

129
00:13:35.024 --> 00:13:37.166
What do you think you're doing?

130
00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:42.507
- My office! Now!

131
00:13:44.463 --> 00:13:47.442
Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal.

132
00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:49.860
Hey, you need to calm down.

133
00:13:56.194 --> 00:14:01.055
Was I not clear that the terms of your
sanctuary here included non violence?

134
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.547
Well I can guarantee you nothing
like this will ever happen again.

135
00:14:05.903 --> 00:14:09.592
Be that as it may, you can
no longer stay here with us.

136
00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:12.719
Your presence, it is just too disruptive.

137
00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:19.323
The truth is that our sanctuary was never
gonna last very long here anyways.

138
00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:22.589
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.

139
00:14:24.522 --> 00:14:27.448
- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.

140
00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:30.375
I understand that you think you can
stay out of this but you can't.

141
00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:32.861
One day she's gonna show up
and Jeanine is gonna take

142
00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:34.959
whatever power you think
you have away from you.

143
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:36.136
Tris! Tris!

144
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.691
Look, Johanna, we need a little more time.

145
00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:46.581
We need to find out where the rest of
the Dauntless are, then we can leave.

146
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:49.239
And then what? Attack Erudite?

147
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.003
- I will not be a part of your violence.
- No one is asking you to.

148
00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:56.091
We just need a few more days.

149
00:15:00.082 --> 00:15:01.771
One.

150
00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:08.116
- One, what?
- One more chance.

151
00:15:11.057 --> 00:15:16.665
See, to be Amity is to forgive
others, and yourself.

152
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:19.788
You're hurting Tris.

153
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:25.731
And my heart goes out to you.

154
00:15:27.275 --> 00:15:33.087
I know what it's like to stand helpless
while you loose the ones you love.

155
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.196
But killing Jeanine will not
gonna bring your mother back.

156
00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:43.391
I know you're angry, but
you're letting it consume you.

157
00:15:46.305 --> 00:15:48.269
- What is it?

158
00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:08.551
Stay here and keep quite.

159
00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:32.600
Gentlemen, Amity welcomes you.

160
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.267
- To what do we owe the pleasure.
- This isn't really a social call Johanna.

161
00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:39.593
- We're looking for divergents.
- I see.

162
00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:41.633
Well of course, anything
we can do to help.

163
00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:43.956
We need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested.

164
00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:48.177
This is screening technology from Erudite.

165
00:16:48.178 --> 00:16:49.486
Amity.

166
00:16:49.487 --> 00:16:50.978
Not that Jeanine is heading
up yo the council the

167
00:16:51.003 --> 00:16:52.403
whole improval processing
got a little easier.

168
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.719
- You're exceeding your jurisdiction.
- Now, Johanna.

169
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.810
What happened to that Amity politeness.

170
00:16:59.011 --> 00:17:04.892
The easy way, or the hard way?
It's up to you.

171
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.827
Alright, but under protest.

172
00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:16.810
Okay we're good to go!
Move it out!

173
00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:23.412
All Amity report to the dome all come to
the dome for new mandatory testing.

174
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.603
Ok, lets go, get inside!

175
00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:49.182
You know something lady?

176
00:17:50.628 --> 00:17:53.110
You seem awfully stuck in that doorway.

177
00:18:05.462 --> 00:18:08.905
Eric is here. We need to move now, come on.

178
00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:20.585
- What's up there?
- Just my office.

179
00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:44.688
There's two guards with guns.

180
00:18:46.254 --> 00:18:47.915
We're going out the window?

181
00:18:49.202 --> 00:18:50.903
We need to split up.

182
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.173
Okey, yeah.

183
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:57.496
Every man for hmself.

184
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.091
Good.

185
00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:02.907
Hey, they're up here!

186
00:19:04.105 --> 00:19:06.472
Hey, they're up here! Come
qon they're getting away!

187
00:19:08.694 --> 00:19:10.106
You're ready?

188
00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:24.911
- Where?
- Out the window!

189
00:19:27.482 --> 00:19:29.292
I got three on foot
heading towards the dome!

190
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.229
- Get them low!
- Repeat, three on foot toward the dome.

191
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.700
Over there!

192
00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:37.924
- I demand amnisty!
- Sit down! Sit down!

193
00:19:38.124 --> 00:19:40.148
I believe in Abignation, it's my right!

194
00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:51.511
- Detain him!
- Let's go!

195
00:19:59.537 --> 00:20:01.241
Come on, keep moving!

196
00:20:12.383 --> 00:20:13.497
Run!

197
00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:15.312
Run!

198
00:20:23.268 --> 00:20:25.021
Come on!

199
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.837
- Listen!
- What?

200
00:21:02.037 --> 00:21:03.302
A train!

201
00:21:05.184 --> 00:21:06.364
Go, go, go!

202
00:21:11.944 --> 00:21:13.115
Caleb!

203
00:21:14.146 --> 00:21:15.148
Keep moving.

204
00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:25.630
Ammo!

205
00:21:40.284 --> 00:21:41.530
Come on, go.

206
00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:03.644
- Go, go!
- Caleb!

207
00:22:04.874 --> 00:22:05.957
Move!

208
00:22:42.135 --> 00:22:44.080
You sure know how to make an entrance!

209
00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:52.704
- Factionless.
- Amity.

210
00:22:52.986 --> 00:22:55.373
Oh, you stare like dogs.

211
00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:58.803
I have no idea what this one is.

212
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:03.031
- Look, we just need to get to the city, thats all.
- Well to bad, the train is taken.

213
00:23:03.345 --> 00:23:06.338
And you damaged our cargo.

214
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:13.620
These are Abnegation and
you are factionless right?

215
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.281
- Caleb!
- I used to be Abnegation.

216
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:18.670
We used the same bolts
to make cloth for you.

217
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:22.202
Are you saying that we steal from you?

218
00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:26.033
No no, I'm no longer Abnegation,
so technically you're not stealing from me.

219
00:23:26.058 --> 00:23:28.883
No, you're not stealing at all.

220
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:33.967
It's a questions of semantics I suppose
wether it's stealing or sharing.

221
00:23:34.167 --> 00:23:36.047
- But it's all really the same.
- That's enough!

222
00:23:36.128 --> 00:23:38.397
Everybody relax alright.
You've made your point.

223
00:23:38.598 --> 00:23:41.966
- We'll get off your train alright.
- Guy, would everybody just relax?

224
00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.795
Why don't we take a seat?

225
00:23:47.277 --> 00:23:49.424
- I was just trying to help!
- Don't.

226
00:23:49.624 --> 00:23:50.957
Yeah, this is going to be fun.

227
00:23:51.157 --> 00:23:53.172
Everybody calm down alright?

228
00:25:13.114 --> 00:25:14.155
Caleb.

229
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.537
Get off! Get off!

230
00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:52.094
- You alright?
- Yup.

231
00:25:52.294 --> 00:25:53.565
Are you okay?

232
00:26:04.932 --> 00:26:07.661
- Tobias Eaton.
- Say it again.

233
00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:10.260
Tobias Eaton.

234
00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:14.200
What you know him?

235
00:26:15.091 --> 00:26:16.242
I am him.

236
00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:25.063
We have been looking for you.

237
00:26:26.788 --> 00:26:28.388
What are they talking about? <br />Four!

238
00:26:46.495 --> 00:26:47.578
Follow me.

239
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:56.021
Tris! I'm sorry, I wanted to help.

240
00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:10.616
Four! Four! Why are they looking for you?

241
00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:13.315
How do they know your your name?

242
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.872
This is factionless.

243
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.345
This is insane.

244
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:09.233
Tobias!

245
00:28:13.117 --> 00:28:14.596
Mother.

246
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.246
I thought she was dead.

247
00:28:26.694 --> 00:28:27.855
Me too.

248
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:46.529
Somebody please tell me
what's going on here.

249
00:28:51.265 --> 00:28:53.872
Tobias's father was very abusive.

250
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:58.977
I knew the only way I could
ever truly escape him was...

251
00:28:59.177 --> 00:29:00.889
to disappear completely.

252
00:29:03.306 --> 00:29:05.996
Abnegation helped me fake my death.

253
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:08.823
Anything to protect Marcus image.

254
00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:11.711
But you just left him
there alone with Marcus.

255
00:29:12.662 --> 00:29:14.393
I was very young.

256
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.092
I reached out to him about a year ago.

257
00:29:18.677 --> 00:29:21.194
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.

258
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:26.360
- I'm still your mother.
- No, my mother is dead.

259
00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:30.132
I went to her funeral when I was six.

260
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:34.450
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.

261
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:37.290
She was trying to use me.
Like you are now.

262
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.491
What?

263
00:29:39.792 --> 00:29:41.114
She wants an army.

264
00:29:41.812 --> 00:29:43.727
- An army?
- I want an alliance.

265
00:29:43.927 --> 00:29:46.816
- No, what you want is revenge!
- This isn't about me.

266
00:29:47.016 --> 00:29:49.066
It's about putting an
end to a system that

267
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:51.331
says one group is more
deserving than another.

268
00:29:51.507 --> 00:29:55.764
This city may be surrounded by a wall
but it doesn't have to be a prison.

269
00:29:56.435 --> 00:29:58.014
I think that's a bit extreme.

270
00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:01.519
I mean, the factions isn't meant
to be perfect but it's hardly a prison.

271
00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:04.626
Let me guess, you're Erudite?

272
00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:08.156
I was Erudite.

273
00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:16.573
- Are you willing to kill Jeanine?
- Absolutely.

274
00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:20.353
When I was married to
Marcus I knew her well.

275
00:30:20.553 --> 00:30:22.880
And believe me, there's
nothing she isn't capable of.

276
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.242
- But I think you already know that.
- Tris, we can't trust her.

277
00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:31.948
- Maybe she knows...
- We're on the same side, Tris.

278
00:30:33.148 --> 00:30:36.252
I'm factionless because I
don't fit in any one faction.

279
00:30:36.452 --> 00:30:39.557
And you're Divergent because
you belong to too many..

280
00:30:39.757 --> 00:30:42.313
But we are both a threat to Jeanine.

281
00:30:43.229 --> 00:30:46.064
My people are ready for war
if that's what it takes.

282
00:30:46.264 --> 00:30:47.265
And then what?

283
00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:51.886
- We depose those in power.
- And once you've done that?

284
00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.531
Once you killed Jeanine,
who's in power then?

285
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:01.955
You see, that's the part she
always conveniently leaves out.

286
00:31:04.097 --> 00:31:07.467
Don't tell me this isn't about
you, this is only about you.

287
00:31:10.302 --> 00:31:13.237
I know where the remaining
Dauntless are hiding.

288
00:31:13.437 --> 00:31:16.395
- Where?
- They took shelter in Candor.

289
00:31:16.595 --> 00:31:18.077
As far as I know they're still there.

290
00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:21.954
Think about it. If we
were to combine forces,

291
00:31:22.154 --> 00:31:26.292
Dauntless and Factionless,
we'd be unstoppable.

292
00:31:26.492 --> 00:31:27.697
That's not gonna happen.

293
00:31:27.898 --> 00:31:32.508
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we will be leaving in the morning.

294
00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:33.963
Four, maybe this is...

295
00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:36.326
Tobias, please reconsider.

296
00:31:36.797 --> 00:31:38.413
Don't you call me that.

297
00:31:41.011 --> 00:31:42.440
My name is Four.

298
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:54.024
You want to talk him in, or should I?

299
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.853
The food looks lovely.

300
00:32:21.312 --> 00:32:22.602
Thank you.

301
00:32:36.098 --> 00:32:37.244
I'm sorry.

302
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:46.821
I should've told you about her.

303
00:32:57.487 --> 00:32:59.496
No more secrets.

304
00:33:00.676 --> 00:33:02.082
Okay?

305
00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:15.863
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

306
00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:22.898
I always loved to watch him sleep.

307
00:33:26.743 --> 00:33:29.451
I take it you're setting out
to Candor in the morning?

308
00:33:29.651 --> 00:33:30.652
Yeah.

309
00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:39.801
Listen, I only want what's best for him.

310
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.572
You hardly even know him.

311
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.937
You'd like to think
that wouldn't you?

312
00:33:47.962 --> 00:33:51.484
But deep inside I think you're
scared I know him all to well.

313
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:56.530
- Im not scared.
- Of course you are.

314
00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.811
You're scared that he'll finally
see you for what you really are.

315
00:34:03.214 --> 00:34:05.090
Deadly.

316
00:34:07.993 --> 00:34:09.714
You don't believe me?

317
00:34:13.597 --> 00:34:15.291
Ask him.

318
00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:23.445
Are you okey?

319
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:24.646
Yeah.

320
00:34:27.061 --> 00:34:29.657
- Sure?
- Yeah.

321
00:35:19.312 --> 00:35:22.395
- Im not going with you guys.
- What?

322
00:35:24.347 --> 00:35:27.577
To Candor. I'm not going with you guys.

323
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.867
- What are you talking about?
- What's your plan?

324
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:37.496
You guys are gonna find the rest
of the Dauntless and then what?

325
00:35:37.948 --> 00:35:39.126
You attack Erudite?

326
00:35:39.327 --> 00:35:41.971
Assasinate Jeanine and start a civil war?

327
00:35:42.947 --> 00:35:45.600
Im sorry, I'm just not cut out for that.

328
00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:49.120
I'm not like you guys.

329
00:35:53.264 --> 00:35:58.605
I need to get back to Abnegation maybe...
...Maybe I can be usefull there.

330
00:35:58.851 --> 00:36:01.759
Caleb, there's nothing left in Abnegation.

331
00:36:04.038 --> 00:36:05.158
Yeah.

332
00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:41.400
- You okey?
- We just need to get to Candor.

333
00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:45.974
Triss!

334
00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:54.335
I know you think Caleb is your
responsibility but he made his own choice.

335
00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:57.247
You can't protect everyone.

336
00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:02.699
- I can't protect anyone.
- Nobody can.

337
00:37:03.627 --> 00:37:07.831
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.

338
00:37:09.963 --> 00:37:13.345
Johanna was right. You
have to forgive yourself.

339
00:37:20.894 --> 00:37:21.936
Thank you.

340
00:37:23.185 --> 00:37:24.942
We gotta move.

341
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:54.278
- We found them!
- Yeah.

342
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.428
- Damn it's good to see you guys.
- How are you?

343
00:38:01.628 --> 00:38:03.708
I'm better now. I'm not
exactly good for layong low.

344
00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:05.059
- Triss!
- Christina!

345
00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:10.610
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

346
00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:12.846
Have you heard anything about Will?

347
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.998
- No.
- Nothing?

348
00:38:18.198 --> 00:38:19.199
No.

349
00:38:20.591 --> 00:38:22.290
Something must have happened to him.

350
00:38:23.172 --> 00:38:25.091
He would've found me by now you know.

351
00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:29.004
- Hey.
- Hey.

352
00:38:29.841 --> 00:38:31.072
How are you holding up?

353
00:38:32.542 --> 00:38:34.846
- How many Dauntless do we have?
- 175 total.

354
00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:37.549
- 175? That's it?
- The rest followed Max.

355
00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:40.253
- Not nearly the number we need.

356
00:38:40.453 --> 00:38:43.185
Hold it! Grab the guns!

357
00:38:45.417 --> 00:38:48.146
- Hey, they're with us.
- We know who you are.

358
00:38:48.346 --> 00:38:51.076
Last warning. Drop your guns.

359
00:38:53.566 --> 00:38:54.976
Alright.

360
00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:07.937
Easy.

361
00:39:20.172 --> 00:39:23.714
- I'm Jack Kang, I'm leadership here.
- We know who you are.

362
00:39:23.914 --> 00:39:25.599
We are not a threat to Candor.

363
00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:28.584
That might be your truth,
it's not neccesarily mine.

364
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:33.481
All I know for certain is you are both wanted
for criminal insurgency and conspiring

365
00:39:33.681 --> 00:39:35.241
in the attack on Abnegation.

366
00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:40.026
Those are lies.

367
00:39:40.126 --> 00:39:43.102
If you were Candor I would
take you at your word.

368
00:39:44.835 --> 00:39:48.075
Unfortunately given the circumstances I'm
obliged to hand you over to the council.

369
00:39:48.223 --> 00:39:51.306
- You can make your case there.
- You might as well kill us now.

370
00:39:51.506 --> 00:39:54.681
If Jeanine finds us, we're not
gonna live to stand trial.

371
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:58.056
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the council.

372
00:39:58.256 --> 00:40:01.958
Are you sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?

373
00:40:03.202 --> 00:40:05.434
Factional law must be upheld.

374
00:40:05.634 --> 00:40:07.548
No, wait wait wait.

375
00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:09.768
Can I ask you one question?

376
00:40:11.235 --> 00:40:12.696
Can I ask you one question?

377
00:40:12.896 --> 00:40:17.455
Jeanine believes that Erudite are the most
fit to govern because they are the smartest.

378
00:40:17.555 --> 00:40:20.962
You believe Candor is the most fittest
to judge because you are so honest?

379
00:40:21.162 --> 00:40:23.589
I admit, I hold that belief.

380
00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:26.363
Then, would you say I
trial held here at Candor

381
00:40:26.563 --> 00:40:29.138
would be inherently more fair
than a trial held by Erudite?

382
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.122
The answer is yes.

383
00:40:35.322 --> 00:40:39.903
In my opinion a Candor trial would have the
greatest chance of achieving true justice.

384
00:40:40.386 --> 00:40:44.034
So you are asking me to petition a
council at the great Candor...?

385
00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:47.883
No. As part of Candors initation
you administer a truth serum.

386
00:40:48.083 --> 00:40:49.084
Correct.

387
00:40:51.146 --> 00:40:53.810
We dont technically discuss such
matters with other factions.

388
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:56.676
- It's a pretty evasive answer.
- Evasion is not dishonest.

389
00:40:56.876 --> 00:40:58.282
But it's not exactly honest either.

390
00:40:59.814 --> 00:41:03.699
- Yes, we possess such a serum.
- Then use it on us.

391
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.001
Four!

392
00:41:05.101 --> 00:41:07.703
If we are guilty, we
surrender to the council.

393
00:41:07.903 --> 00:41:10.697
If not, you just saved two lives.

394
00:41:10.897 --> 00:41:14.198
- And gain some loyal allies.
- Alright.

395
00:41:14.398 --> 00:41:16.730
But you should know the
serum can be quite brutal.

396
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:21.336
It was designed for tender applicants who
are already predisposed to honesty.

397
00:41:21.536 --> 00:41:24.532
Not everyone find it so easy
to share their secrets.

398
00:41:26.193 --> 00:41:28.497
- I do not want to do it.
- We have to.

399
00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:31.617
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.

400
00:41:41.652 --> 00:41:43.581
Let the truth set you free.

401
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.311
Tobias Eaton.

402
00:42:06.335 --> 00:42:10.266
You are accused of conspiring with your
fellow Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation.

403
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:12.606
Is this true?

404
00:42:14.482 --> 00:42:16.500
Conspiring no.

405
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.518
But I did attack.

406
00:42:18.718 --> 00:42:21.219
I was in simulation
controlled by Jeanine and

407
00:42:21.244 --> 00:42:23.688
the rest of the Dauntless
she had recruited.

408
00:42:24.806 --> 00:42:26.288
Tris found me.

409
00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:32.921
She managed to break me free from the
simulation and together we fought are way out.

410
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:41.145
So you are saying that Jeanine
orchestrated this attack?

411
00:42:42.714 --> 00:42:44.066
Yes.

412
00:42:48.584 --> 00:42:50.196
One last thing.

413
00:42:51.687 --> 00:42:56.461
If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted
Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?

414
00:42:57.918 --> 00:43:00.066
Why did you stay?

415
00:43:00.475 --> 00:43:02.483
I wanted to leave.

416
00:43:03.558 --> 00:43:05.840
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.

417
00:43:09.313 --> 00:43:10.983
And I could not leave her.

418
00:43:19.612 --> 00:43:21.771
Thank you for your Candor.

419
00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:23.930
Thank you for your Candor.

420
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.774
Tobias Eaton, this trial
has concluded and you are

421
00:43:26.799 --> 00:43:29.441
resolved of the guilt on
the attack on Abnegation.

422
00:43:31.994 --> 00:43:33.568
Miss Prior if you would.

423
00:43:44.886 --> 00:43:46.665
Let the truth set you free.

424
00:44:01.625 --> 00:44:02.891
Tris Prior.

425
00:44:05.113 --> 00:44:07.539
Mr Eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim.

426
00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:11.527
Yes.

427
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.292
So you were never under
the simulation yourself.

428
00:44:15.615 --> 00:44:16.650
No.

429
00:44:17.776 --> 00:44:19.316
How is that possible?

430
00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.907
Because im divergent.

431
00:44:29.369 --> 00:44:31.033
I see.

432
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:38.214
So you never harmed any of your fellow
Dauntless or the Abnegation?

433
00:44:38.415 --> 00:44:42.247
I did.

434
00:44:49.893 --> 00:44:51.031
Who?

435
00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:55.544
My mom.

436
00:44:58.033 --> 00:45:03.571
I watched her die first and then my dad.

437
00:45:03.671 --> 00:45:06.453
They were killed trying to save me.

438
00:45:14.208 --> 00:45:18.330
Miss Prior, the more you resist,
the more painfull the serum will be.

439
00:45:25.964 --> 00:45:30.595
My friend... I killed my friend.

440
00:45:31.313 --> 00:45:33.380
He was trying to shoot me.

441
00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:42.264
And... I shot him first.

442
00:45:46.437 --> 00:45:48.297
What was his name?

443
00:45:54.729 --> 00:45:56.577
What was his name?

444
00:46:00.316 --> 00:46:04.806
Will. I killed Will.

445
00:46:09.488 --> 00:46:17.454
This is what happens to
people that get close to me.

446
00:46:26.043 --> 00:46:27.585
They get hurt or they die.

447
00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:32.830
I can't forgive myself.

448
00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:37.801
Thank you for your Candor.

449
00:46:38.002 --> 00:46:40.077
Thank you for your Candor.

450
00:46:55.336 --> 00:46:58.451
Tris!

451
00:47:01.721 --> 00:47:03.660
Im sorry.

452
00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:07.484
I told you I didnt want to do that.

453
00:47:19.967 --> 00:47:20.968
- Christina.
- Go.

454
00:47:24.329 --> 00:47:25.656
Go.

455
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:37.267
Abnegation sim complete.

456
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.142
Dauntless sim initiated.

457
00:47:43.885 --> 00:47:46.112
Mam, the Divergents viable is dropping.

458
00:47:46.312 --> 00:47:48.895
If we dont pull her out of
the sim soon we'll loose her.

459
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.097
You stop when I say so.

460
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.518
She's gonna do it.

461
00:48:02.727 --> 00:48:04.656
She's gonna pass the sim.

462
00:48:07.799 --> 00:48:10.484
Dauntless sim failed.

463
00:48:11.851 --> 00:48:14.284
Divergent test subject
six is no longer viable.

464
00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:19.414
Alright shut it down.

465
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.217
We are wasting our time.

466
00:48:25.293 --> 00:48:29.573
I've been asuming all the
Divergents are the same.

467
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:35.060
But some are stronger than others.

468
00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:41.060
Assign all non essential
personnel to Divergent detail.

469
00:48:41.338 --> 00:48:43.263
We need to work harder.

470
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:45.885
We need to find that very special one.

471
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.751
Where's your scary boyfriend?

472
00:49:11.488 --> 00:49:13.731
Probably out doing scary boyfriend things.

473
00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:21.317
Mind if I join you?

474
00:49:26.066 --> 00:49:27.513
I love heights.

475
00:49:29.432 --> 00:49:31.774
Up here everyting seems
much smaller, you know.

476
00:49:34.527 --> 00:49:36.442
I know it sounds crazy, but...

477
00:49:36.809 --> 00:49:40.682
Sometimes I think I see
lights out beyond the wall.

478
00:49:42.844 --> 00:49:46.967
I know they say its all just
wasteland out there but...

479
00:49:48.812 --> 00:49:52.018
We can't be the only ones left. Can we?

480
00:49:57.395 --> 00:49:58.552
C'mon!

481
00:49:58.752 --> 00:50:00.910
- Got any weapons?
- No!

482
00:51:19.063 --> 00:51:20.681
Coast clear, moving out!

483
00:51:48.965 --> 00:51:52.080
Mommy! Mommy!

484
00:51:54.451 --> 00:51:59.002
That thing hurt me?

485
00:51:59.895 --> 00:52:01.886
You see? It's ok.

486
00:52:02.673 --> 00:52:07.144
It's just something to help you go to
sleep. I need you to do me a favour.

487
00:52:07.344 --> 00:52:09.554
You have to go to the
top of the stairs and

488
00:52:09.579 --> 00:52:11.839
don't come down until
your mommy comes here.

489
00:52:12.015 --> 00:52:15.160
Don't come down. Can you do that?

490
00:52:16.618 --> 00:52:18.126
Be brave, ok?

491
00:52:19.279 --> 00:52:21.593
Ok, go.

492
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.721
Hey!

493
00:52:59.255 --> 00:53:00.925
Why are we the only ones awake?

494
00:53:02.237 --> 00:53:03.698
Because we're Divergents.

495
00:53:03.898 --> 00:53:06.518
Come on, I need your help to open this.

496
00:53:06.719 --> 00:53:08.599
I need your help.

497
00:53:14.203 --> 00:53:15.331
Hey!

498
00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:18.671
Look who decided to show up.

499
00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:27.777
It's really good to see you again.

500
00:53:33.927 --> 00:53:37.518
Alright folks, nothing to be nervous about.

501
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.830
It's a little routine inspection,
then we all go back to our business.

502
00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:45.519
Hello.

503
00:53:50.202 --> 00:53:52.658
Divergent 10 %.

504
00:53:54.073 --> 00:53:55.469
Shit.

505
00:53:56.207 --> 00:53:57.820
You're almost normal.

506
00:53:58.819 --> 00:53:59.831
That's boring.

507
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:04.052
That is not part of the mission.

508
00:54:04.252 --> 00:54:05.403
So what?

509
00:54:06.837 --> 00:54:09.197
As far as I'm concerned the
rest of them are still outlaws.

510
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.851
Let's just wrap this up quick.
The others is gonna be awake soon.

511
00:54:26.248 --> 00:54:28.131
- Hi, sweetie.
- I should not...

512
00:54:30.949 --> 00:54:34.749
- Divergent 40%.
- I'm afraid it's not you either.

513
00:54:36.656 --> 00:54:38.153
The lady said that I should not...

514
00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:42.229
The lady said that I shouldn't
have come downstairs.

515
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.677
Maybe you should have listened.

516
00:54:55.847 --> 00:54:58.634
Enough! You still have to test her.

517
00:55:01.203 --> 00:55:03.068
Jeanine stold us we have to test everyone.

518
00:55:10.643 --> 00:55:14.389
- Divergent 100%.
- I'll be damned.

519
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.325
- What?
- She's what we've been looking for.

520
00:55:17.962 --> 00:55:19.900
Bullshit.

521
00:55:23.867 --> 00:55:26.306
Divergent 100%.

522
00:55:28.782 --> 00:55:29.973
Get her in the veichle.

523
00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:31.924
I'll alert Jeanine.

524
00:55:36.244 --> 00:55:39.388
If you think you got lucky, you are wrong.

525
00:55:40.399 --> 00:55:42.846
You gonna wish I killed you.

526
00:55:57.967 --> 00:55:59.750
Drop your weapons!

527
00:56:14.573 --> 00:56:15.774
Thank you.

528
00:56:17.627 --> 00:56:19.268
It's lucky you got that gun Four.

529
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:24.637
We both know your'e not much without one.

530
00:56:55.883 --> 00:56:59.841
You think you're safe now?
You're wrong.

531
00:57:00.927 --> 00:57:02.987
Jeanine will never gonna
stop searching for you.

532
00:57:06.562 --> 00:57:12.151
Why? What she want with her? Tell me!

533
00:57:12.387 --> 00:57:17.123
It's exactly what Jeanine needs.
It's the perfect subject.

534
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:22.825
Is that supposed to scare me?

535
00:57:24.546 --> 00:57:27.394
You're responsible for the
death of hundreds of people.

536
00:57:27.419 --> 00:57:29.147
You know the
punishment for that.

537
00:57:29.889 --> 00:57:34.560
Listen... I found a way to live
with the blood on my hands.

538
00:57:36.093 --> 00:57:37.320
But can you?

539
00:58:08.689 --> 00:58:10.300
Why dont they come out?

540
00:58:10.574 --> 00:58:13.516
All I know is that they put me sleeping
and then all hell break lose.

541
00:58:13.517 --> 00:58:14.717
Heck, don't play!

542
00:58:26.013 --> 00:58:27.390
You know what this means.

543
00:58:28.657 --> 00:58:30.018
Thank you.

544
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:33.752
- For helping us.
- I wish I could do more.

545
00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:37.195
I had no idea Jeanine was capable
of something like this.

546
00:58:38.236 --> 00:58:40.608
It's time we fight back.

547
00:58:40.718 --> 00:58:42.369
- We don't have the numbers.
- We will.

548
00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:45.703
Once we get the Factionless.

549
00:58:50.573 --> 00:58:51.584
You heard Eric.

550
00:58:52.253 --> 00:58:56.643
Jeanine is not gonna stop coming after you.
It's are only option.

551
00:59:02.595 --> 00:59:06.644
Tris Prior. Of course.

552
00:59:06.645 --> 00:59:08.700
It had to be her.

553
00:59:09.575 --> 00:59:12.082
- Is she still off the grid?
- Yeah.

554
00:59:12.467 --> 00:59:14.570
But I think I found a solution.

555
00:59:18.483 --> 00:59:21.172
- It's Peter, right?
- Yeah.

556
00:59:21.756 --> 00:59:25.740
Jeanine, can I just say it's truly an honor
to finally meet you in person.

557
00:59:27.677 --> 00:59:28.855
Congratulations mother.

558
00:59:30.258 --> 00:59:31.512
You got your war.

559
00:59:32.025 --> 00:59:36.037
- I know you wish there was another way.
- But there isn't.

560
00:59:39.162 --> 00:59:41.393
I'm the lesser of two evils, is that it?

561
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.242
- It better be.
- Tell me...

562
00:59:51.383 --> 00:59:53.219
Why did you surrender to Erudite?

563
00:59:55.177 --> 00:59:56.778
What do you want?

564
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.072
I would like a position in your regime.

565
01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:05.703
Ideally I would like a position with
some advancement opportunities.

566
01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:09.342
I may be Dauntless but I'm
not just some meathead.

567
01:00:11.312 --> 01:00:13.164
No offense, Max.

568
01:00:17.337 --> 01:00:19.657
Prove your worth to us.

569
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.665
Then we can discuss your ambitions.

570
01:00:23.032 --> 01:00:24.434
Great.

571
01:00:25.364 --> 01:00:26.706
When do I start?

572
01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:29.138
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.

573
01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:34.002
- How do I flush her out?
- It's simple.

574
01:00:34.003 --> 01:00:36.838
The girl is a walking bleeding heart.
She was borne out of Abegnation.

575
01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:39.497
It's her weak spot. You just
have to know how to press it.

576
01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:42.569
Help! Come quick.

577
01:00:52.746 --> 01:00:57.287
Traitor Tris Prior must be
surrendered to Erudite.

578
01:00:57.288 --> 01:00:59.831
Or every day more death will follow.

579
01:01:06.088 --> 01:01:07.182
Hand over Tris Prior.

580
01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:10.646
Or every day more death will follow.

581
01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:15.414
Hand over Tris Prior.

582
01:01:15.904 --> 01:01:18.445
Or every day more death will follow.

583
01:01:23.232 --> 01:01:24.641
Hand over Tris Prior.

584
01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:27.439
- Or every day more death will follow.
- Christina!

585
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.641
No!

586
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:43.096
Christina!

587
01:01:43.877 --> 01:01:45.208
Help me!

588
01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:47.170
Tris!

589
01:02:24.155 --> 01:02:26.361
We removed this from the
body of the suicidal.

590
01:02:26.656 --> 01:02:30.883
Marlene. Her name was Marlene.

591
01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:34.304
I'm sorry. Marlene.

592
01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:37.605
It's a very sophisticated
sim serum injector.

593
01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:39.748
It also has a radio
transmitter in it's head.

594
01:02:39.808 --> 01:02:43.066
- How do we get them out?
- I don't know.

595
01:02:43.211 --> 01:02:45.508
This tech was built to defend itself.

596
01:02:45.743 --> 01:02:46.894
This tendril...

597
01:02:47.915 --> 01:02:49.889
wraps around the nearest major artery.

598
01:02:49.917 --> 01:02:54.323
If you try to removed them...
and it kills the host.

599
01:02:54.862 --> 01:02:56.073
Kill the host?

600
01:02:58.825 --> 01:03:00.134
So what do we do?

601
01:03:00.135 --> 01:03:03.328
Tori must neutralize the disk
before we do anything else.

602
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.377
Or we can do the logical thing.

603
01:03:05.822 --> 01:03:07.253
We hand her over.

604
01:03:07.563 --> 01:03:11.810
Nobody knows about this alliance,
we have to protect that advantage.

605
01:03:11.811 --> 01:03:13.469
If we hand Tris over now...

606
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.001
it might buy some time.

607
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:26.764
I think it's a good idea.

608
01:03:27.312 --> 01:03:30.078
But you have to go through me first.

609
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:32.737
- Me too.
- And us.

610
01:03:45.482 --> 01:03:47.989
I am the one with a time bomb in my arm!

611
01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:20.641
I know what you're thinking.

612
01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.250
But I'm not gonna let you do it.

613
01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:34.950
I can't let anyone else die because of me.

614
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.387
No one else is gonna die because of you.

615
01:04:37.847 --> 01:04:39.817
Tori will disable the disk.

616
01:04:40.017 --> 01:04:43.213
- And if she doesn't?
- Then...

617
01:04:45.656 --> 01:04:49.473
If she doesn't, we figure it out.

618
01:04:50.759 --> 01:04:51.862
Together.

619
01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:54.568
You know, I'm just one person.

620
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.438
- I'm not worth it.
- You are worth it.

621
01:05:00.638 --> 01:05:02.590
You are more than worth it to me.

622
01:05:04.347 --> 01:05:06.028
I love you.

623
01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:19.888
This city may be safe behind a closed wall,

624
01:07:20.363 --> 01:07:25.059
but make no mistake, that wall alone
doesnt ensure our security.

625
01:07:27.057 --> 01:07:33.940
It's up to us, everyone of us, to remain
vigilant and isolate any threat against us.

626
01:07:35.193 --> 01:07:39.306
There are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained.

627
01:07:40.114 --> 01:07:43.986
Permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders.

628
01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:48.678
I'm aware that there has been some concerns
about the unavoidable raid on Candor

629
01:07:48.679 --> 01:07:52.232
so let me be clear.

630
01:07:53.785 --> 01:07:57.217
The harbouring of
Divergents from any faction

631
01:07:57.218 --> 01:07:59.127
can not be tolerated.

632
01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:03.750
Very soon I will present
what I believe to be no

633
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:06.723
less than a mandates from
the founders themselves.

634
01:08:07.575 --> 01:08:12.870
On this I have no doubt on the measure
I have taken to keep the peace.

635
01:08:13.563 --> 01:08:18.027
I have provided instructions that will allow
us to eradicate the Divergence crisis.

636
01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:19.852
Once and for all.

637
01:08:35.017 --> 01:08:36.549
Where are you going?

638
01:08:37.415 --> 01:08:39.056
She has left. She's gone.

639
01:08:40.561 --> 01:08:42.852
What? When?

640
01:08:43.482 --> 01:08:45.061
- Last night.
- Wait.

641
01:08:49.227 --> 01:08:52.549
Tobias! People look to you for leadership.

642
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.912
You can't just abandon them

643
01:08:59.823 --> 01:09:00.939
Tobias!

644
01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:11.758
Wow!

645
01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.869
I have to admit that I'm surprised.

646
01:09:17.197 --> 01:09:19.158
I mean, I know that you are dumb but..

647
01:09:19.495 --> 01:09:22.847
I didn't think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here.

648
01:09:23.048 --> 01:09:24.609
And turn yourself in.

649
01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:31.866
The killings had to stop.

650
01:09:32.938 --> 01:09:36.277
That just shows that you can
take the girl from Abnigation

651
01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:38.614
but you cant take Abnigation out of her.

652
01:09:39.183 --> 01:09:41.335
Let's go.

653
01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:44.437
Once a stiff, always a stiff. Right?

654
01:09:55.048 --> 01:09:58.871
- What is this?
- What is this? This is the whole reason you are locked Tris.

655
01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.675
Man I love knowing stuff you don't.

656
01:10:03.455 --> 01:10:05.637
I need you to open that box Tris.

657
01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:14.882
The only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions.

658
01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:20.073
But te only people who have
tried to it so far have died.

659
01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:25.658
I don't think I was
supposed to tell you that.

660
01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.191
Well...

661
01:10:28.218 --> 01:10:29.870
No pressure.

662
01:10:30.699 --> 01:10:32.041
Remarkable!

663
01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:37.562
The chances of it being you of all people.

664
01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:40.890
You're the... laws of probability.

665
01:10:44.466 --> 01:10:46.795
As remarkable as many people
you managed to murder?

666
01:10:49.538 --> 01:10:52.002
Dark times call for extrme measures.

667
01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.952
You may find it hard to believe.

668
01:10:57.022 --> 01:10:59.563
But I'm serving the greater good.

669
01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:03.751
Step up on the disc please.

670
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:27.473
Step up on the disc please.

671
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.781
Mam?

672
01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:48.451
Stop the suicides or I
swear I will shoot him.

673
01:11:48.992 --> 01:11:53.465
That's okey. You can kill him if you want,
we have plenty of guards.

674
01:11:55.035 --> 01:11:56.368
What?

675
01:12:34.423 --> 01:12:39.510
I'm guesing you need me alive
for this to work. Right?

676
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.422
Right?!

677
01:12:56.499 --> 01:12:58.705
Tris.

678
01:13:01.719 --> 01:13:02.980
Caleb.

679
01:13:04.909 --> 01:13:06.283
Caleb.

680
01:13:06.604 --> 01:13:10.187
Don't engage to subject.

681
01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:13.428
Conditions are already less then optimal.

682
01:13:22.849 --> 01:13:23.950
My God.

683
01:13:34.779 --> 01:13:37.633
If I do this the suicides stop?

684
01:13:40.094 --> 01:13:43.749
No. The suicides will continue.

685
01:13:44.298 --> 01:13:47.749
Until you suced and pass all five sims.

686
01:13:49.103 --> 01:13:51.716
That should be sufficient enough.

687
01:13:54.538 --> 01:13:55.749
Good luck.

688
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:08.901
Let's begin.

689
01:15:11.183 --> 01:15:13.149
Initialize the Dauntless sim.

690
01:15:32.955 --> 01:15:36.181
Mom.

691
01:15:39.151 --> 01:15:40.365
Tris, help me!

692
01:16:10.835 --> 01:16:12.646
Heart rate is rising.

693
01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:15.495
Keep her in play.

694
01:16:35.045 --> 01:16:36.236
Mom!

695
01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:48.113
I'm coming.

696
01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.427
Mom!

697
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:31.133
I'm coming.

698
01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:18.365
Tris!

699
01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:20.757
Hold on!

700
01:18:31.596 --> 01:18:32.940
Tris.

701
01:18:34.781 --> 01:18:36.751
Dauntless sim complete.

702
01:18:51.264 --> 01:18:54.799
- I miss you so much.
- I know you do.

703
01:18:56.326 --> 01:18:57.993
But I'm still with you..

704
01:19:09.414 --> 01:19:11.168
You need to be strong now.

705
01:19:12.663 --> 01:19:14.424
Tell me you're gonna be strong.

706
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:17.005
- I'm trying.
- You can do this.

707
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.120
I know you can.

708
01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:23.982
You're brave. Braver than anyone.

709
01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:27.560
I'm not brave mom.

710
01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.792
I pretend that I am.

711
01:19:33.759 --> 01:19:36.631
I want people to think
that I am, but I'm not.

712
01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.467
I'm really really scared and...

713
01:19:44.129 --> 01:19:47.162
Maybe we are actually
what's wrong in this world.

714
01:19:48.796 --> 01:19:50.665
Divergents.

715
01:19:51.946 --> 01:19:54.680
I never wanted any of this.

716
01:19:55.549 --> 01:19:58.962
You and dad and Caleb and Four.

717
01:19:59.778 --> 01:20:06.320
I can't help but think that if I was normal
we would all still be together.

718
01:20:08.145 --> 01:20:11.089
Mom, I don't want to be Divergent anymore.

719
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:14.278
I just want to feel safe again.

720
01:20:17.138 --> 01:20:19.414
Candor sim complete.

721
01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:42.171
Four. You're here?

722
01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:43.817
Yeah, I'm here.

723
01:20:45.902 --> 01:20:47.601
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

724
01:20:48.998 --> 01:20:50.510
Secure the hallway.

725
01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:55.760
Let's get you out of here.

726
01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.838
- You good?
- Yeah.

727
01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.409
Stop. Let him go.

728
01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:17.719
Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?

729
01:21:18.716 --> 01:21:20.511
Once a stiff, always a stiff.

730
01:21:33.294 --> 01:21:34.370
Go!

731
01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:44.428
Four, how did you get passed security?

732
01:21:44.429 --> 01:21:47.075
You know me, scary boyfriend skills.

733
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.024
What is it?

734
01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:59.234
You weren't there. You
didn't even hear that.

735
01:22:01.226 --> 01:22:02.437
Tris.

736
01:22:02.976 --> 01:22:04.758
We need to leave now. Alright?

737
01:22:06.199 --> 01:22:07.734
I'm sorry Four.

738
01:22:08.518 --> 01:22:11.606
- What?
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was gonna go.

739
01:22:12.755 --> 01:22:14.133
I wanted to say goodbye,

740
01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:15.709
but I just didnt know how.

741
01:22:15.885 --> 01:22:18.757
- I didn't know how.
- What are you talking about?

742
01:22:22.714 --> 01:22:25.808
Even though I didn't
get to say it in

743
01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:29.171
real life, at least I
get to say it now.

744
01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:33.744
- Even if it is just a sim.
- Tris, we're not in a sim.

745
01:22:34.455 --> 01:22:38.334
Don't you think I would
know if I were in a sim?

746
01:22:38.359 --> 01:22:40.811
Four... you're not in a sim.

747
01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:47.249
- You're the sim.
- Wait, wait.

748
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:21.849
Erudite sim complete.

749
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:26.519
- There's only Amity now.
- She hasn't passed Abnegation yet.

750
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.516
Yes she has. When she spared your life.

751
01:23:31.742 --> 01:23:33.949
This girl is extraordinary.

752
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.030
She tested positive for

753
01:23:36.055 --> 01:23:37.533
four factions in one day.

754
01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.841
No one has gotten that far.

755
01:23:43.439 --> 01:23:44.650
We got a problem.

756
01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:52.463
She's crashing. We have to rest her.

757
01:23:53.548 --> 01:23:56.428
Are you sure you're not letting
familiar attachment cloud your judgement?

758
01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:57.999
See for yourself.

759
01:24:06.059 --> 01:24:07.120
Very well.

760
01:24:09.362 --> 01:24:10.950
Detach the subject.

761
01:24:22.264 --> 01:24:25.569
Good work, gentlemen. We
will resume tomorrow.

762
01:25:08.253 --> 01:25:11.366
You were never planing on going
back to Abnegation, were you?

763
01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:16.256
I had to do what I though was right.

764
01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:19.502
My parents would be ashamed of you.

765
01:25:20.835 --> 01:25:23.512
Well maybe not. I mean I'm

766
01:25:23.537 --> 01:25:26.214
willing to sacrifice you.

767
01:25:27.314 --> 01:25:28.920
The only family I have left.

768
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.140
The only person that I love.

769
01:25:30.163 --> 01:25:32.275
In order to preserve what's
best for everyone else.

770
01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.791
What's more selfless than that?

771
01:25:45.587 --> 01:25:47.209
What does Jeanine think

772
01:25:47.234 --> 01:25:48.785
is in that box Caleb?

773
01:25:49.129 --> 01:25:50.704
It's a message from the founders.

774
01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:55.503
But the box was to be opened
only if the factions broke down.

775
01:25:55.504 --> 01:25:56.504
Which is why we require

776
01:25:56.528 --> 01:25:57.787
someone like you to open it.

777
01:25:59.044 --> 01:26:01.063
You're living proof
that the Divergent

778
01:26:01.088 --> 01:26:03.054
problem has grown
beyond all control.

779
01:26:03.777 --> 01:26:04.926
Do you even hear what you

780
01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:05.962
are saying right now?

781
01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:08.609
No one think it's your fault

782
01:26:08.634 --> 01:26:10.102
that you were born this way.

783
01:26:10.294 --> 01:26:12.554
Jeanine murdered an entire faction Caleb.

784
01:26:12.555 --> 01:26:14.804
That faction could no longer be trusted.

785
01:26:14.805 --> 01:26:16.090
She killed our parents.

786
01:26:16.091 --> 01:26:18.712
Are parents brought that on themselves.

787
01:26:18.912 --> 01:26:19.992
What are you talking about?

788
01:26:21.449 --> 01:26:23.706
The box, it was in their house.

789
01:26:23.707 --> 01:26:25.610
They were the ones hiding it.

790
01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:27.714
All those lives could have been spared.

791
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:32.150
Seems we didnt knew our parents
as well as we thought we did.

792
01:26:35.036 --> 01:26:37.659
Alright family reunion is
over, it's time to go.

793
01:26:45.873 --> 01:26:48.227
I got a little surprise for you Tris.

794
01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.871
- Four!
- Tris!

795
01:26:54.179 --> 01:26:58.010
Tris!

796
01:26:58.210 --> 01:27:03.513
Four!

797
01:27:10.949 --> 01:27:16.350
I gather your brother explained how vital the work
you're doing here is to the future of the city.

798
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:17.916
Please just let Four go.

799
01:27:19.497 --> 01:27:24.406
If his well being is such a concern you
should focus on the task at hand.

800
01:27:26.912 --> 01:27:29.605
Tell me...
Do you appreciate irony?

801
01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:35.275
You tested positive for Erudite so
you must have the intellectual capacity.

802
01:27:35.679 --> 01:27:36.777
Irony.

803
01:27:36.778 --> 01:27:38.901
For instance. Right
now you are full of

804
01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:41.101
hate, but you need to
pass an Amity sim.

805
01:27:46.155 --> 01:27:48.745
Then there are other ironies at work too.

806
01:27:49.104 --> 01:27:51.499
- Such as the fact your cherish mother...
- Don't.

807
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.624
That you so dauntlessly
saved in the sim is

808
01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.844
the reason you're in
this mess to begin with.

809
01:27:55.845 --> 01:27:57.265
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

810
01:27:57.266 --> 01:27:59.546
- And then there the most
pointed irony of all.

811
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:00.305
- Stop.

812
01:28:00.306 --> 01:28:04.910
That Nathalie Prior not only died trying
to protect the data that I now have.

813
01:28:04.911 --> 01:28:05.938
Because you stole them.

814
01:28:05.963 --> 01:28:06.965
You killed her for it!

815
01:28:06.966 --> 01:28:09.208
Data that she so selfishly

816
01:28:09.233 --> 01:28:11.966
withheld. But her own daughter,

817
01:28:11.967 --> 01:28:16.367
her beloved Divergent Tris is going to
be the one who delivered it to me.

818
01:28:16.368 --> 01:28:17.488
- I said stop!
- Therefore...

819
01:28:18.305 --> 01:28:22.166
your mother's death, just like
your boyfriend's death...

820
01:28:22.167 --> 01:28:25.022
will mean absolutely nothing.

821
01:29:33.223 --> 01:29:37.806
Don't pull her out. Not yet.

822
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.983
No!

823
01:30:32.114 --> 01:30:33.319
Bring her back!

824
01:30:36.378 --> 01:30:37.719
Bring her back.

825
01:30:39.381 --> 01:30:40.722
Now!

826
01:30:41.619 --> 01:30:42.856
Bring her back!

827
01:30:43.056 --> 01:30:44.456
Come on!

828
01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:46.661
Come on!

829
01:30:50.373 --> 01:30:51.513
Bring her back!

830
01:30:51.642 --> 01:30:53.439
Test subject seven is no longer viable.

831
01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:19.742
I really thought you were the one.

832
01:31:32.116 --> 01:31:33.217
We just...

833
01:31:36.153 --> 01:31:39.896
We just have to resume are search.

834
01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:57.218
Find solace in your faction, Caleb.

835
01:31:57.611 --> 01:31:59.521
We are your family now.

836
01:32:46.295 --> 01:32:47.997
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.

837
01:33:17.746 --> 01:33:20.089
Hey, Four, can you do that thing you do?

838
01:33:26.844 --> 01:33:28.716
Hey Four, that's pretty good right?

839
01:33:28.891 --> 01:33:31.119
First I stole paralytic
from infirmary then I

840
01:33:31.144 --> 01:33:33.516
shot her up when she was
freaking out about you.

841
01:33:33.561 --> 01:33:35.538
I mean I told these guys
I was pretty smart.

842
01:33:35.563 --> 01:33:37.013
I guess they should've listened.

843
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.871
- You're real!
- Yeah I'm real.

844
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.889
- What are you doing here?
- You die, I die.

845
01:33:57.543 --> 01:34:00.372
Ohh... okay guys come on.
Lets go, seriously.

846
01:34:00.397 --> 01:34:01.811
You can do that later.

847
01:34:02.752 --> 01:34:04.228
- You're ok?
- Yeah.

848
01:34:08.382 --> 01:34:11.163
- Thank you, Peter.
- Yeah whatever. No we're even, stiff.

849
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:12.965
Alright, come on let's go.

850
01:34:13.165 --> 01:34:15.515
- Before Jeanine realizes we're gone.
-

851
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:18.394
- What?
- The box! We have to get the box!

852
01:34:18.395 --> 01:34:20.527
Are you kidding me?
Now is not the time for souvenir tris!

853
01:34:20.528 --> 01:34:21.926
Four, you have to listen to me.

854
01:34:22.165 --> 01:34:23.965
It's not what Jeanine think
it is, I know it's not.

855
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:25.310
My mother would
have destroyed it.

856
01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:27.725
We have to get it.

857
01:34:31.183 --> 01:34:33.613
Peter, is there another way to the lab?

858
01:34:34.306 --> 01:34:37.264
I mean, I have to go to the control
room to disable all the doors.

859
01:34:37.265 --> 01:34:38.692
Okay you do that!

860
01:34:40.872 --> 01:34:42.423
- Okay, right now?
- Yeah.

861
01:34:42.684 --> 01:34:44.955
You just choose our side
whether you meant to or not.

862
01:34:45.265 --> 01:34:47.535
If you want to survive, make sure we do.

863
01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.740
Let's go!

864
01:34:52.668 --> 01:34:53.668
Fuck!

865
01:35:22.449 --> 01:35:24.950
No guns. It draws less attention.

866
01:35:26.981 --> 01:35:29.029
- Hey.
- Hold up!

867
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:41.383
- Access Denied.
- Come on!

868
01:36:09.046 --> 01:36:11.281
- Access granted.
- Let's go..

869
01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:15.329
- Is that it?
- Yes.

870
01:36:15.418 --> 01:36:17.070
Grab it and let's go.

871
01:36:20.389 --> 01:36:24.372
- Security breach.
- What's going on?

872
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:29.418
- What's going on? What is it?
- There's been a breach in the sim room.

873
01:36:29.419 --> 01:36:31.565
I want to see who the hell is in there.

874
01:36:31.566 --> 01:36:33.557
- The cameras are down in that sector.
- I'll send the guards there.

875
01:36:33.558 --> 01:36:36.456
Bring up every cell!

876
01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:37.600
Now!

877
01:36:44.607 --> 01:36:45.706
Show her.

878
01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:48.671
Tori finally found a way
to get them out safely.

879
01:36:48.672 --> 01:36:51.973
- How many others?
- Every last one of them.

880
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:57.067
Let's go!

881
01:37:00.893 --> 01:37:04.131
Tris! Tris, come on, we gotta move.

882
01:37:05.515 --> 01:37:06.957
Tris we have to move!

883
01:37:07.817 --> 01:37:10.555
I can't!, I can't.

884
01:37:10.843 --> 01:37:12.010
My mom died protecting

885
01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:13.413
what ever is inside this.

886
01:37:15.234 --> 01:37:16.463
I have to open it for her

887
01:37:16.488 --> 01:37:17.642
and I think I know how.

888
01:37:17.643 --> 01:37:21.116
- If we dont leave here now we're not getting out.
- I have to do this first.

889
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:24.429
I know it doesn't make much sense
but you have to trust me, please.

890
01:37:26.414 --> 01:37:28.209
You have my life apparently.

891
01:37:34.592 --> 01:37:36.007
Get in.

892
01:37:40.764 --> 01:37:41.839
Don't move!

893
01:37:47.433 --> 01:37:49.210
Initializing Amity sim.

894
01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:55.366
Back again are we.

895
01:37:56.658 --> 01:37:59.054
You're an even bigger
fool than your mother.

896
01:38:03.799 --> 01:38:06.081
You can say whatever you want Jeanine.

897
01:38:07.206 --> 01:38:08.921
But I'm not gonna fight you.

898
01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:12.432
- How very Amity of you.
- I mean it.

899
01:38:14.618 --> 01:38:17.654
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Of course you're not.

900
01:38:18.652 --> 01:38:20.853
You're gonna fight her.

901
01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:25.505
The one you really hate.

902
01:38:58.217 --> 01:38:59.487
What are you?

903
01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.462
I'm you, Tris.

904
01:39:05.687 --> 01:39:07.883
I'm the real you.

905
01:39:18.248 --> 01:39:19.421
I'm not gonna fight you.

906
01:39:19.874 --> 01:39:21.858
- I'll make you fight me.
- You're not me.

907
01:39:21.859 --> 01:39:25.296
I am. I'm what the others see
when they're looking at you.

908
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:44.992
You killed Will and your parents.
You're deadly.

909
01:39:45.777 --> 01:39:46.893
Enough!

910
01:39:51.202 --> 01:39:55.165
No one's gonna love you Tris.
They're not even gonna miss you.

911
01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:57.423
This world will only be
better off without you.

912
01:39:57.623 --> 01:40:00.266
One less Divergent ruining things.

913
01:40:00.376 --> 01:40:06.466
And no one will ever forgive
you for what you've done.

914
01:40:07.351 --> 01:40:08.665
You're wrong.

915
01:40:16.638 --> 01:40:19.910
Because I will.

916
01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.097
Amity sim complete.

917
01:41:02.653 --> 01:41:04.311
- No!
- No! Stop!

918
01:41:08.671 --> 01:41:11.264
Initializing message.

919
01:41:30.068 --> 01:41:31.259
Hello.

920
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:33.672
I come from outside the wall.

921
01:41:34.442 --> 01:41:37.047
Where we have all destroyed each other.

922
01:41:37.565 --> 01:41:41.377
We designed your city as an experiment.

923
01:41:42.003 --> 01:41:46.137
We believed it was the only way to recover
the humanity we had lost.

924
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:51.899
And we created factions to ensure peace.

925
01:41:53.272 --> 01:41:57.922
We believed that there will be those among
you who will transcend these factions.

926
01:41:59.345 --> 01:42:01.654
These will be the Divergent.

927
01:42:03.596 --> 01:42:06.151
They are the true purpose
of the experiment.

928
01:42:06.152 --> 01:42:10.822
They are vital to humanity's survival.

929
01:42:12.367 --> 01:42:17.662
If you're watching this now than at least one of
you are proof that our experiment has succeeded.

930
01:42:19.203 --> 01:42:25.360
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

931
01:42:25.479 --> 01:42:28.860
We have allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us,

932
01:42:28.861 --> 01:42:30.652
but you're not.

933
01:42:31.234 --> 01:42:35.999
Mankind waits for you, with hope,

934
01:42:36.199 --> 01:42:38.528
beyond the wall.

935
01:42:45.971 --> 01:42:48.496
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

936
01:42:52.267 --> 01:42:53.368
Yes.

937
01:43:10.923 --> 01:43:13.427
You're wrong about us.

938
01:43:17.268 --> 01:43:22.533
We were never the problem.
We're the solution.

939
01:43:34.802 --> 01:43:37.383
- Bury the box.
- What?

940
01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:40.209
No one sees it. Ever.

941
01:43:43.774 --> 01:43:45.224
Kill them both.

942
01:43:45.282 --> 01:43:46.420
No!

943
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:54.751
Don't move.

944
01:43:59.345 --> 01:44:01.847
Put your weapons down now!

945
01:44:01.848 --> 01:44:06.312
- Stay!
- Do not move!

946
01:44:10.138 --> 01:44:11.585
Hello, Jeanine.

947
01:44:13.207 --> 01:44:14.431
Evelyn.

948
01:44:14.432 --> 01:44:16.311
Impressive.

949
01:44:16.471 --> 01:44:18.280
I think we're gonna like it here.

950
01:44:19.163 --> 01:44:22.076
Do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this?

951
01:44:22.657 --> 01:44:24.668
Because you're so popular?

952
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:28.662
Get her out of here.

953
01:44:29.453 --> 01:44:31.415
When that message gets

954
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.579
out it will be the end.

955
01:44:51.263 --> 01:44:52.985
What message?

956
01:44:56.538 --> 01:44:58.694
You'll see. I'm gonna put it

957
01:44:58.719 --> 01:45:01.027
on every monitor in the city.

958
01:45:03.373 --> 01:45:06.046
We have seperated you from the rest of us.

959
01:45:08.018 --> 01:45:11.273
And we created factions to ensure peace.

960
01:45:13.168 --> 01:45:17.769
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

961
01:45:19.115 --> 01:45:22.673
We have allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us,

962
01:45:22.852 --> 01:45:24.101
but you're not.

963
01:45:24.677 --> 01:45:30.896
If you're watching this now than at least one of
you are proof that our experiment has succeeded.

964
01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:37.934
Mankind waits for you, with hope,

965
01:45:38.761 --> 01:45:41.814
beyond the wall.

966
01:46:18.006 --> 01:46:19.640
These will be the Divergent.

967
01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:22.284
They are the true purpose
of the experiment.

968
01:46:22.285 --> 01:46:25.847
They are vital to humanity's survival.

969
01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.481
You did it.

970
01:46:36.019 --> 01:46:38.320
Everyone's staring at me.

971
01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.904
You changed everything.

972
01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.459
What now?

973
01:46:45.591 --> 01:46:47.363
Only one way to find out.

974
01:46:48.501 --> 01:46:49.502
Are you ready?

975
01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:56.436
It's been over 200 years.

976
01:47:59.564 --> 01:48:01.170
Who knows what's out there?

977
01:48:04.012 --> 01:48:05.710
You'll never find out.
