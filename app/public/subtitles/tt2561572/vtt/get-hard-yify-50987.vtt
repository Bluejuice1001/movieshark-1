00:10:45.068 --> 00:10:46.097
我準備好了 
I'm ready for it.

145
00:10:47.098 --> 00:10:49.093
我在佛得角買了一塊島 
You know, I bought an island in Cape Verde.

146
00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:52.010
一整塊島 
An entire island.

147
00:10:52.077 --> 00:10:53.097
你也可以的 
You can too.

148
00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:57.052
我很願意,我們可以做島鄰 
I would love to. We could be island neighbors.

149
00:10:58.053 --> 00:11:00.094
你可以游過來 借一杯黃金 
You could swim over and borrow a cup of gold.

150
00:11:05.037 --> 00:11:06.086
好 
Yeah.

151
00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:09.061
想想這一切都始於此 
You know, and to think it all started with this.

152
00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:11.020
我還留著那台電腦呢 
I still have that computer.

153
00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:15.033
它提醒著我卑微的出身 
It reminds me of my humble beginnings.

154
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.054
我如何一手創辦了這個公司 
How I built this company with my own two hands.

155
00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:21.021
當時只有我,那台電腦... 
Just me, that computer...

156
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.084
以及從我爸爸那裡 貸來的八百萬美元 
and an $8 million loan from my father.

157
00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:29.067
你確實完全靠自己 
You really did it all on your own.

158
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.047
非常勵志,先生 
Very inspiring, sir.

159
00:11:34.056 --> 00:11:38.018
現在聽著,不許再說 “先生”這類廢話 
Now, listen, I want you to drop this "sir" nonsense.

160
00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:40.089
看在老天的份上,你要娶我的女兒 
You are marrying my daughter, for Pete's sake.

161
00:11:42.074 --> 00:11:44.023
我希望你叫我“爸爸” 
I want you to call me "Dad."

162
00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:47.023
真的嗎?爸爸? 
Really? Dad?

163
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.082
感覺很不錯 
That feels very good.

164
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.074
我的親生爸爸從沒有時間陪我 
My real father never had time for me.

165
00:11:55.042 --> 00:12:00.041
他送我去倫敦的寄宿學校跟默多克和本·拉登 兩個家族呆在一起 
He shipped me off to boarding school in London with the Murdochs and the bin Ladens.

166
00:12:01.017 --> 00:12:02.075
當然了,那是以前... 
Of course, that was before...

167
00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:08.017
我們知道他們踢假球 但不知道... 
I mean, we knew they cheated in soccer, but, had no idea...

168
00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:09.038
其實... 
you know...

169
00:12:11.002 --> 00:12:12.051
可如果我能選擇一個爸爸... 
But if I could choose a dad...

170
00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:16.010
嘿,我跟你說 你們現在是一家人,孩子 
Hey, you know something, you're family now, kid.

171
00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:21.014
好啦 
Okay, then.

172
00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:23.048
好了 
Oh, boy.

173
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.002
混賬東西 
Motherfucker.

174
00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.055
金先生 
- Mr. King. - Aah! Aah!

175
00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:50.088
盡情拿你想要的東西吧! 
Take whatever you want!

176
00:12:51.006 --> 00:12:52.026
- 請! - 噢,風帽讓你誤會了 
- Please! - It's the hood.

177
00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:54.018
- 嘿!是達內爾 - 救命! 
- Hey! It's Darnell. - Help!

178
00:12:55.056 --> 00:12:56.097
- 救命! - 住手,金先生,不要! 
- Help! Help! - Stop! Mr. King. No!

179
00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:00.006
- 噢,親愛的上帝,救命啊! - 住手!你太荒唐了! 
- Oh, dear Lord. Someone help me! - Stop it! You're being ridiculous!

180
00:13:00.023 --> 00:13:01.089
停!看看我 
Stop! Look at me.

181
00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:03.069
是我啊 
It's me.

182
00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:05.073
你的鑰匙給你! 
I got your keys!

183
00:13:07.049 --> 00:13:09.048
沒錯!我看見你了 
Yes! I see you.

184
00:13:10.054 --> 00:13:12.032
抱歉,我不是有意要嚇你 
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

185
00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.032
給你 
- Here you go. - Oh.

186
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:16.032
- 對不起 - 謝謝 
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

187
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.062
如你所知,如果你是白人 我也會做同樣的事情 
And, uh, just so you know, I would have done the same thing if you were white.

188
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.041
幸好知道了 
That's good to know.

189
00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:24.012
嘿,金先生 
Hey, Mr. King.

190
00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:29.075
你既然在這兒了,我就想... 我想跟你說上一會兒話 
While I got you out here, I just wanna... I just wanna talk to you for a second.

191
00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:32.001
到目前為止,我為你 洗車已達兩年之久... 
I've been washing your car for two years now...

192
00:13:32.018 --> 00:13:35.063
我能看出來你是那類 喜歡最上等東西的人 
and I can tell you're the type of man who likes the best of everything.

193
00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:40.014
因此,作為好萊塢豪華泡泡的 老闆和首席執行官... 
So as owner and CEO of Hollywood Luxury Bubbles...

194
00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:45.002
我想給您一張 價值三萬美金的... 
I wanted to offer you an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card...

195
00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:47.077
獨家白金終身洗車卡 
for $30,000.

196
00:13:48.016 --> 00:13:49.077
在你開口之前... 
Now, before you say anything...

197
00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:54.015
先想想這筆投資會給你 節省的金錢數額 
think about the type of money that you'll save with this investment.

198
00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.074
實際上,金錢的時間價值是... 
Well, actually the time value of money is such that...

199
00:13:56.092 --> 00:14:00.028
如果我把同等金額的錢財 投放到我自己的基金... 
if I were to put that same amount in my own fund...

200
00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:05.004
長達二十三年之久 我已經至少收穫了三百萬 
in 23 years' time, I'd have in excess of $3 million.

201
00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:06.021
哇,沒錯 
Wow. Yeah.

202
00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:09.075
根據那樣的回報率,我可以每次 在車髒了的時候再買一部新車 
With that rate of return, I could buy a new car every time it gets dirty.

203
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.005
- 這不是很令人深刻嗎? - 太讓人吃驚了,金先生 
- Isn't that impressive? - Amazing, Mr. King.

204
00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:14.021
你知道的,我走到今天的位置... 
That's the magic of compounded interest.

205
00:14:14.043 --> 00:14:17.093
不是別人救濟的 
You see, I didn't get to where I am today by asking for handouts.

206
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.072
而是通過努力工作 
But by hard work.

207
00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:22.043
今天,那樣的努力工作 終於得到了回報... 
And today, that hard work paid off...

208
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:26.010
而我剛剛被提升為公司的合夥人 
as I was just named partner in my firm.

209
00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:27.052
金先生,那... 
Mr. King, that is...

210
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.044
- 太了不起了 - 非常感謝

211
00:14:30.082 --> 00:14:33.019
- 那... - 謝謝 
- That is... - Thank you.

212
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.053
太令人吃驚了,金先生,聽我說 
That's amazing. Mr. King, listen to me.

213
00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:38.011
我是你所遇到過的最勤奮的工人之一了 
I'm one of the hardest workers you'll ever meet.

214
00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:41.041
所以我每天都在這裡洗車 
I mean, that's why I'm down here power-washing cars every day.

215
00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:43.099
我覺得面對面交談 
I just felt with this face-to-face that you would...

216
00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:47.087
可以讓你幫一個老闆同行和工作創造者 
That you would wanna help a fellow business owner and job creator.

217
00:14:48.005 --> 00:14:52.000
我是在幫你啊,所以我說不了 
I am helping you. By saying no.

218
00:14:52.018 --> 00:14:55.063
- 金先生,這... - 那樣,你就能自力更生了 
- Mr. King, that's... - That way, you can make it on your own.

219
00:14:55.081 --> 00:14:59.068
好了,金先生,已經有很多人這樣幫我了 
Okay. Mr. King, I have a lot of people helping me that way already. And... And...

220
00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:03.043
太好了,那你應該有成功大計了 
Great. Then you have a plan for success.

221
00:15:03.061 --> 00:15:04.093
之前怎麼不說? 
Why didn't you tell me that?

222
00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:09.089
你看,每個人無論出身 富裕還是貧困... 
You see, everyone, whether we're born rich or poor...

223
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:11.061
無論是白人... 
or white...

224
00:15:11.082 --> 00:15:13.090
還是其他人種... 
or miscellaneous...

225
00:15:14.008 --> 00:15:15.069
我們會成為什麼樣的人... 
who we become...

226
00:15:15.087 --> 00:15:18.053
取決於我們自己的選擇,就這麼簡單 
is based on our own decisions. It's simple as that.

227
00:15:18.075 --> 00:15:21.020
你知道還有誰是從車庫起家的嗎? 
You know who else started in a garage?

228
00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:24.062
惠普- 帕卡德 所以你在的公司很好

229
00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:27.062
- 關於這一點... - 不,先生... 
- And on that note... - No, Mister...

230
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.092
- 你不必給我那麼多,金先生 - 等等,等等 
- You don't have to give me that much, Mr. King. - Hold on, hold on.

你被指控證券欺詐和挪用公款

- These transaction records prove you're guilty. - I've never seen these. These are fakes!

不要,我相信司法系統會還我清白 
No. I have faith that the justice system will exonerate me.

不會的,詹姆斯,因為我會安排偵查員調查此事 
That's not gonna happen, James, because I'm gonna put my investigators...

314
00:20:34.073 --> 00:20:38.001
馬不停蹄,直到找出真相 
on this twenty-four-seven until we find out who really did this.

你要確保自己別離開本郡 讓燈一直亮著

Yeah. No, we all did. I just didn't wanna bring it up first, that's all.

381

別這樣,他們可能是要把你 送往某個聯邦俱樂部監獄 
Come on. They're probably sending you to some Club Fed prison.

00:24:42.052 --> 00:24:45.047
如果你聽說的是群交的話,那就是了 
If you heard everybody fucking, it is. That's how bad it is.

395
00:24:45.065 --> 00:24:46.097
我沒聽說那種事 
I didn't hear that part.

396
00:24:47.032 --> 00:24:49.035
他們敢情會喚那監獄作 聖操蛋,老兄 
They might as well call it San Fucking, man.

397
00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:54.023
那裡實在爛透了 什麼叫糟糕,那就是糟糕 
I don't wish that on my worst enemy. You talking about bad? That's bad.

你們在說什麼? 
What are you talking about?

401
00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:03.086
你坐過牢 
Well, the fact that you went to prison.

402
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:05.087
我坐過牢? 
The fact that I went to prison?

403
00:25:06.008 --> 00:25:08.049
對,你坐過牢 
Yes. Look, you did your time.

404
00:25:08.067 --> 00:25:12.071
你償還了對社會的債務 
You paid your debt. And we as society...

405
00:25:12.088 --> 00:25:15.012
社會應該歡迎你回來,真的

406
00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:17.092
你我是同路中人 
You and I are exactly the same.

407
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.009
只是你沒有選舉權 
Except you can't vote, ever.

408
00:25:21.022 --> 00:25:24.068
趁我脾氣還沒變得更糟 金先生,趕緊痛快點告訴我 
Just before I get to another level of anger, Mr. King, tell me for giggles...

409
00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:26.084
你怎麼知道我坐過牢? 
- how do you know I went to prison? - It's simple.

410
00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:29.056
其實很簡單 我只是做了點統計分析,是這樣的: 
- Statistical analysis is what I do. - Here's the deal:

411
00:25:29.073 --> 00:25:33.056
每三個黑人中就會有一個 進過監獄 
One out of three black men will find themselves incarcerated during their lifetime.

412
00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.048
- 想一下比薩,可以吧? - 好 
- Imagine a pizza, okay? - Okay.

413
00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.085
有那麼三片

三片黑色的 
Three black pieces.

415
00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:46.082
這三片比薩中有一片會在 某個時刻被扔進牢房裡去 
One of those pieces of pizza will be thrown in jail at some point during it's life.

416
00:25:47.058 --> 00:25:50.012
我跟你說說我的統計分析 
You know what? Let me give you my statistical analysis.

417
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:52.079
你會去聖昆丁監獄,可以百分之百確定 
You going to San Quentin. There's 100 percent chance...

418
00:25:52.096 --> 00:25:55.067
你會成為某人的小婊子 會有十年時間一直這樣 
- that you're gonna be somebody's bitch. - Ten years of this:

419
00:25:58.051 --> 00:25:59.067
你知道是什麼嗎? 
- You know what that is? - Mm-mm.

420
00:25:59.085 --> 00:26:01.067
會有一個大屁股黑人 光顧你蒼白的翹臀 
A big-ass black man on your pale white ass.

421
00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:08.005
你會說:“不!我受夠了! 別這樣!夠了” 
YOU: "No! I don't want any more! Stop! That's enough."

422
00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:10.097
太晚了,他走之後 下一個傢伙又來了 
Too late. He done tagged the next guy in.

423
00:26:11.086 --> 00:26:13.085
就像只兔子,而你不想再要他了 
That's like a rabbit. You don't want him no more...

424
00:26:14.003 --> 00:26:16.039
因此現在就有別人想劫你色 
so now here comes the guy that wants to rub your face.

425
00:26:16.057 --> 00:26:18.069
“我喜歡他的頭髮” 你都能感受到他的喘息 
"I like his hair." He's breathing on you.

426
00:26:18.086 --> 00:26:22.011
太噁心了,不過你猜怎麼著? 你可以過十年這種日子! 
That's disgusting. But guess what? You can look forward to 10 years of it!

427
00:26:22.028 --> 00:26:24.074
要是我集結所有的小婊子們... 
What if I speak to all the bitches and we organize...

428
00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:27.070
成為一個聯盟,並立場堅定地 說:“夠了!” 
form a union, and we put our feet down and say, "Enough!"

429
00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:30.024
- 我們人數會比他們多 - 其實我們沒他們多 
- There's gotta be more of us than them. - There's not.

430
00:26:30.042 --> 00:26:34.016
你所受的一切都是你應得的 先生,祝你能活下來 
You deserve everything you're getting. Good luck on survival, sir.

431
00:26:34.034 --> 00:26:36.079
希望你能管好自己! 
Better luck on handling yourself!

432
00:26:37.005 --> 00:26:40.050
等等!等等!等等!別走 求你別走,我會請你幫忙 
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't leave. Don't leave, please. I could use your help.

433
00:26:40.068 --> 00:26:41.071
幫你什麼?! 
Help you with what?

434
00:26:43.006 --> 00:26:45.034
幫我別成為別人的婊子 
Help me to not be someone's bitch.

435
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.001
你指望我幫你?! 我該教你點什麼?! 
You expect me to help you? I'm supposed to teach you what?

436
00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:51.039
怎樣避免這些: 
How to prevent this:

437
00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:55.093
- 好吧,打住 - 你可以訓練我 
- All right, stop. - You could train me.

438
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.002
你可以做我這奧德賽的雅典娜 
You could be the Athena to my Odysseus.

439
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.031
夥計,我都不知道 你說的是啥意思! 
I don't even know what the fuck that is, man!

440
00:27:02.007 --> 00:27:03.032
我可以花錢請你 
I could pay you.

441
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.036
你要什麼都滿足你 
Whatever it takes.

442
00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:07.011
我要三萬美金 
I need $30,000.

443
00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:09.041
沒問題 
- Done. - Oh...

444
00:27:09.058 --> 00:27:10.082
好 
Okay.

445
00:27:11.058 --> 00:27:12.095
對,嗯 
Yup. Yeah.

446
00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:15.045
- 很好 - 沒錯 
- Fantastic. - All right.

447
00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:18.008
你在幹嘛? 
What are you doing?

448
00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:19.062
我只知道這兩個 
I only know these two.

449
00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.075
你要幹什麼? 
What are you trying to do?

450
00:27:21.093 --> 00:27:24.080
- 握手?你想跟我握手? - 噢,就是普通的

- Thank you, Darnell. - I'll see you in the morning, convict.

453
00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:31.047
你在幹嘛?那是什麼? 
What are you doing? What is that?

454
00:27:31.065 --> 00:27:32.097
- 試著來幹這件事 - 不 
- Trying to do this thing. - No.

455
00:27:33.015 --> 00:27:34.093
- 握手,沒事的 - 好 
- Shake. It's fine. - Okay.

456
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:37.022
金先生,不,我來吧

- 好,沒問題 - 非常感謝

我就知道我會有出頭之日

462

老子要有房子了 
I'm getting the house.

463
00:27:57.063 --> 00:28:01.033
老子要有房子了 
I'm getting the house. Unh!

464
00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:07.076
寶貝,這完全說不通啊 
Babe. This does not make any sense.

465
00:28:07.093 --> 00:28:09.042
他幹嘛要雇你? 
Why would he hire you?

466
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.093
- 因為他覺得我在牢裡呆過 - 看,這部分我不明白 
- Because he thinks I went to prison, babe. - That's the part I don't get.

467
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.076
- 你幹嘛要告訴他? - 我沒有把那個告訴他,他自己猜的 
- Why would you tell him that? - I didn't. He assumed that.

468
00:28:15.094 --> 00:28:16.093
- 他猜的? - 沒錯! 
- He assumed it? - Yes!

469
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.010
那你因為什麼讓他猜你進過監獄? 
So what reason did you give him to assume that you went to jail?

470
00:28:20.028 --> 00:28:21.044
我是個黑人 
I was being black.

471
00:28:23.028 --> 00:28:26.027
- 這太可惡了 - 我不知道這怎麼就可惡了 
- This is nuts. - Okay. I don't get what's nuts to you.

472
00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:30.011
三十天內,我們就能拿到錢 這房子就是我們的,有問題嗎? 
In 30 days, we'll have the money, the house will be ours. What is the problem?

473
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:34.007
問題是,他永遠不會相信 你進過監獄 
The problem is he is never going to believe that you went to jail.

474
00:28:34.038 --> 00:28:37.066
聽著,寶貝,我是你妻子 所以我還是直說吧 
Look, babe. I am your wife, so I will put it to you straight.

475
00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:40.000
你完全不像個混混 
You are not exactly a thug.

476
00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:42.092
沒吃過雞肉,還沒看過雞跑啊? 
I don't have to be a thug to portray a thug. Okay?

477
00:28:43.068 --> 00:28:47.063
老實說,我所要做的就是改變我的聲音 說話聲音低沉一點 
Honestly, all I gotta do is change my voice, talk a little deeper.

478
00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:51.009
這樣說話,非常刻板 他就已經認為我是了 
IN DEEP VOICE Talk like this and be every stereotype he already thinks I am.

479
00:28:51.027 --> 00:28:53.084
現在,我就是個混混了 現在就是 
Right now, I'm thugging. This is thugging.

480
00:28:54.002 --> 00:28:56.047
寶貝,這方面你太棒了 
You're so good at it, sweetie.

481
00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.064
晚安 
Have a good night.

482
00:28:59.065 --> 00:29:02.085
- 賤人!別從我身邊走開! - 你剛對我說什麼?! 
- Bitch! Don't walk away from me! - What the hell did you just say to me?

483
00:29:03.003 --> 00:29:05.044
- 老婆,住手 - 你腦子有毛病?! 
- IN NORMAL VOICE Girl, stop. Stop! - What is wrong with you?

484
00:29:05.061 --> 00:29:08.098
那是什麼?!我愛你!我在入戲! 
What is that? I love you! I was playing!

485
00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:13.015
- 賤人 - 啥?! 
- Bitch. - What?

486
00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:15.011
我什麼都沒說! 
- I didn't say nothing! - Oh.

487
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:17.012
我什麼都沒說 
Man, I didn't say nothing.

488
00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:19.041
你想看《戀戀筆記本》嗎? 
You wanna watch The Notebook?

489
00:29:19.092 --> 00:29:22.066
- 我愛你和瑪凱拉 - 嗯,我也愛你,晚安 
- I love you and Makayla. - Yeah, I love you too. Good night.

Please leave a message after the tone.

493
00:29:31.043 --> 00:29:32.084
嗨,爸爸在嗎? 
Hi, Dad?

494
00:29:33.002 --> 00:29:34.068
我是詹姆斯 
It's James.

495
00:29:34.085 --> 00:29:38.018
我想問問調查員那兒有信兒沒 
Just wondering if there's any word from the investigators.

496
00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:40.001
依然愛你 
I still love you.

497
00:29:41.086 --> 00:29:43.052
謝謝你,再見 
Thank you. Bye.

498
00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:47.086
我現在聽說了你 一件很瘋狂的事情,這傢伙是詹姆斯·金嗎? 
Now, I heard a crazy story about you. This guy James King?

499
00:29:48.003 --> 00:29:52.065
我聽說你在他被捕的聚會上 還表演來著 
And I heard that you played at the party where he got arrested.

500
00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:56.003
對,我不知道我在給個怪物表演 
Yeah. I had no idea that I was performing for a monster.

501
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:59.053
我都不知該怎麼解釋 怎麼能拿那種人的錢 
I don't know how to explain what it's like to take money from someone like that.

502
00:29:59.071 --> 00:30:01.054
你真的想把錢還回去... 
It makes you wanna give it back to them...

503
00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:04.037
可這樣會更糟糕 因為這筆錢就歸他了 
except that would be worse because then they'd have it.

504
00:30:05.022 --> 00:30:09.054
就是那種無助的感覺下 我覺得我們的創作被金錢把持... 
And it's that whole helpless feeling that I have about our creative process being monetized...

505
00:30:09.072 --> 00:30:12.059
那感覺給了我寫這首歌的靈感... 
and that's what inspired me to write this song...

506
00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:15.026
這首歌在今天午夜 就能在iTunes上下載了 
which is actually available on iTunes tonight at midnight.

507
00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:17.059
- 前提是我還能演奏它的話 - 很好 
- If I can play it. - Great.

508
00:30:18.069 --> 00:30:21.047
*我沒有千里眼 
SINGING I can't see through walls.

509
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.010
*也沒有讀心術 
And I can't read your mind.

510
00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.094
*但如果我能覺察到 
But if I did I'd find.

511
00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:32.086
*那個詹姆斯·金是個大壞蛋 
That man James King is a great big turd.

512
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.078
*或者說是個小賤人 
I mean the small, small kinds.

513
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.045
*但是那混蛋詹姆斯會 
But that **** James.

514
00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:42.049
*手抵在大牢裡墻面壁 
Will fall Hands against the prison wall.

515
00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:45.058
*和給別人亂搞口交 
Choking on a mouthful of balls.

516
00:30:45.084 --> 00:30:48.021
*他會做的一口好活 
He'll be choking on A mouthful of balls

517
00:30:48.038 --> 00:30:50.029
我並不願意這麼講 不過這確是首好歌 
I hate to admit it, but it's a good song.

518
00:30:50.047 --> 00:30:53.030
很好,謝謝約翰·梅爾 
FALLON: Okay, very nice. John Mayer, everybody.

519
00:30:53.047 --> 00:30:56.013
現在我要夢見蛋蛋了 
Now I'm gonna be dreaming about balls.

520
00:30:57.035 --> 00:30:58.080
嘿,羅素

我給你五百美金,你告訴我 監獄是什麼樣子的吧 
how would you like to make $500 just for telling me what prison was like.

525
00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:13.069
其實我不想說 羅素,我不該說那些的 
Well, I don't wanna say that. Russell, I shouldn't have to say that.

526
00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:15.094
為什麼?!怎麼...? 
For what?! What is...?

527
00:31:16.012 --> 00:31:17.044
好吧,行 
Fine. Fine.

528
00:31:17.062 --> 00:31:20.020
我是個人見人罵的混賬東西 
I'm a Cliff Huxtable pussy-looking motherfucker.

529
00:31:21.008 --> 00:31:23.062
不!我甚至都沒穿卡其褲 
No! I'm not even wearing khakis.

530
00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:29.071
羅素,你能幫我一下 我跟你說的事情嗎?從頭開始吧 
Russell, can you please just help me, what I'm asking you for? Just start from the beginning.

531
00:31:29.088 --> 00:31:34.000
不,不行,要從頭,從頭開始 從進大牢的第一天開始 
No, no. Like, the beginning, the beginning. Like, the first day of prison.

532
00:31:35.085 --> 00:31:37.021
從第一天就開始了?! 
On the first day?

533
00:31:37.043 --> 00:31:40.001
不用暖場嗎? 
Oh. There's no warm-up?

534
00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:41.089
太傷感了 
That's sad.

535
00:31:42.052 --> 00:31:44.064
羅素,很抱歉 我剛才是不是聽到了槍聲? 
Russell, I'm sorry, did I just hear a gunshot?

536
00:31:44.086 --> 00:31:47.014
你該走了,好,再見 
You gotta go. Okay. Bye.

537
00:31:48.004 --> 00:31:51.053
入獄前22天

538
00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:57.086
準備好了,媽媽...? 
Ready, mother...?

準備好了嗎,混賬東西?! 
- You ready, motherfucker?! - Aah!

00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:27.022
- 噢,疼死我了! - 這是防狼噴霧劑,賤人! 
- Oh, it burns! - Pepper spray, bitch!

549

第一誡:你一定要 有所防備,知道嗎? 
RULE NUMBER ONE: You always be on guard, okay?

On the inside, there's somebody on every corner to fuck you up!

551

好吧,我們開始吧 
All right. Let's get started.

556
00:32:51.026 --> 00:32:53.046

If you follow this guide and do exactly what I say you will survive in prison.

牢獄準備教程

559
00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:00.038
“保險箱” 
JAMES: "Keistering."

560
00:33:00.056 --> 00:33:04.080
- 保險箱是什麼東西? - 慢點!你還沒準備好 
- What's keistering? - Slow down! You ain't ready for that.

561
00:33:04.098 --> 00:33:06.005
你是個老師 
You're the teacher.

562
00:33:06.023 --> 00:33:10.093
我只是想讓你知道,我願不惜任何代價 在監獄裡活下來 
And I just want you to know I'll do whatever it takes to survive and get my life back.

563
00:33:11.011 --> 00:33:12.094
很好,因為我要 給你打個預防針: 
That's good, because let me tell you something:

564
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:15.048
你要受你從來沒受過的罪 
You're gonna have to work harder than you ever worked before.

565
00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:20.061
其實,我還在哈佛商學院上學的時候 面對過很多棘手的問題 
Back when I was in Harvard Business School, I was facing some pretty long odds.

566
00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:23.003
不過我都把問題解決 而且成功了 
But I buckled down and I succeeded.

567
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:25.082
我在哈佛的時候 你有沒有因為掛科被強姦過? 
When you was at Harvard, did you ever get raped for failing a test?

568
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.078
我覺得那是耶魯的傳統 
I think that's more of a Yale thing.

569
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:36.033
- “耶魯” - 抱歉 
- "Yale." - I'm sorry.

570
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:39.075
你丫閉嘴! 
Shut the fuck up!

571
00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:43.097
從現在開始 這不再是你的房子了 
Now from this point on, this ain't your house no more.

572
00:33:44.014 --> 00:33:47.034
- 這是聖昆丁!你明白嗎? - 明白 
- This San Quentin! You understand me? - Okay.

573
00:33:47.081 --> 00:33:49.051
從現在開始這會是你的牢房 
DARNELL: From now on this will be your cell.

574
00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:52.047
沒有我的許可 你不能離開這個屋子 
You do not leave this room without my permission.

575
00:33:54.003 --> 00:33:55.048
沒問題 
It's good.

576
00:33:57.016 --> 00:33:59.098
- 先生,你就睡這兒吧 - 繼續,我們沒時間玩鬧了 
- For you to sleep on, se?or. - Go on, we ain't got time for games.

577
00:34:00.016 --> 00:34:01.078
去樓上,把這地方變成監獄 
Go upstairs, turn this place into prison.

578
00:34:01.095 --> 00:34:05.045
我很願意報答你的恩德 
It will be our pleasure to repay you for your many kindnesses.

579
00:34:08.029 --> 00:34:10.099
把那個放在 有小雞雞的雕像前面 
Put that in there in front of the statues with the dicks.

580
00:34:11.046 --> 00:34:12.079
詹姆斯,聽著 
James, listen to me.

581
00:34:12.096 --> 00:34:16.017
要想在監獄裡活下來 關鍵是要遵守一個簡單的問題: 
The key to survival in prison lies in the following simple questions:

582
00:34:16.034 --> 00:34:18.042
你是不是夠強硬? 你能管住你自己嗎? 
Are you hard? And can you handle yourself?

583
00:34:18.084 --> 00:34:23.021
其實,這是樂觀主義轉瞬即逝的時刻 因為那答案是確鑿的 
Well, this is a rare moment for optimism because the answer to that is a resounding yes.

584
00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:26.013
好,那很好,讓我看一下你的瘋狗臉 
That's good. Let me see what your mad-dog face look like.

585
00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:28.084
- 不好意思,什麼瘋狗? - 你這個瘋狗啊! 
- I'm sorry. What's a mad dog? - You a mad dog!

586
00:34:29.002 --> 00:34:30.093
- 噢,糟了 - 你丫是個什麼玩意,黑鬼? 
- Oh, shit. - What's your what, nigga?

587
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:33.035
- 你想要什麼就拿什麼! - 讓我看看那個! 
- Take whatever you want! - Let me see that!

588
00:34:33.053 --> 00:34:35.002
不! 
No!

589
00:34:36.024 --> 00:34:38.098
- 別!求你了! - 放馬出來吧 
- Stop! I beg of you! - Like a pit bull with no leash.

590
00:34:42.066 --> 00:34:44.003
那就是瘋狗 
That's a mad dog.

591
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.036
哇,我覺得你非常勝任這事 
Wow. I knew you were the right guy for the job.

592
00:34:46.054 --> 00:34:50.087
在監獄裡,瘋狗臉對你的生存至關重要 你明白嗎,詹姆斯? 
In prison, a mad-dog face is essential to your survival. Do you understand me, James?

593
00:34:51.004 --> 00:34:55.066
所以現在要做的是,我的臉上要有一種 我肯定可以打死你的表情 
So the idea is that I make a face that conveys the fact that I'd have no problem hurting you.

594
00:34:56.009 --> 00:34:58.071
沒錯,現在給我來個那表情,我看一下 
Exactly what it is. Now, convey that shit. Let me see it.

595
00:34:58.088 --> 00:35:01.046
好 
Okay. Ahem.

- That's terrible. - Ha, ha.

597
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:09.068
不,太慫了 夥計,要有怒火,你要讓我看到你的怒火 
No, that's horrible, man. Anger. You gotta show me anger.

598
00:35:09.085 --> 00:35:13.022
- 你笑什麼? - 我沒笑,我很緊張 
- Why you smiling? - I'm not smiling. I'm tense and I'm agitated.

599
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.077
別這樣啊,老兄! 
Come on, man!

600
00:35:15.007 --> 00:35:16.085
啊?那就是你的瘋...就這?! 
- Unh! - That's your mad... That's it?!

601
00:35:17.003 --> 00:35:19.044
- 你的未婚妻離你而去了 - 沒錯 
- Your fiancée left you. - That's right!

602
00:35:19.061 --> 00:35:21.040
- 你對此高興嗎? - 不高興 
- You happy about that? - No.

603
00:35:21.057 --> 00:35:24.007
那就來點怒火!她要離開你了?! 她現在在幹什麼?! 
Then get mad! She gonna leave you? What is she doing?

604
00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:27.090
她可能在一輛車的後座 給別人吹簫 
She probably on her knees sucking somebody dick in the back seat of a truck.

I'm sad-dogging you.

610
00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:46.017

00:45:53.025 --> 00:45:55.070
你永遠不能活著出去 
You're never getting out alive! Ha, ha.

814
00:45:56.037 --> 00:45:57.087
操你媽的! 
Fuck a bag of tits!

815
00:45:58.008 --> 00:46:00.054
放狗! 
Release the dogs!

816
00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:02.041
什麼?放狗? 
What? Dogs?

817
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:10.046
你無處可逃了,詹姆斯先生 
There's nowhere to run, Mr. James.

818
00:46:11.093 --> 00:46:14.013
你真是不知天高地厚啊 
You don't know when to quit, Mr. James.

819
00:46:28.078 --> 00:46:31.007
你連西西裡奧和吉娃娃的掌心都逃不出 
You couldn't get past Cecelio and some Chihuahuas.

820
00:46:31.024 --> 00:46:35.011
你要如何逃出聖昆丁監獄? 別再浪費時間了 
Tell me how you gonna escape San Quentin. Stop wasting my time, James.

821
00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:40.045
這就是非法翻越圍欄的下場,知道嗎? 
That's what happens when you try to jump a fence illegally. Hm?

822
00:46:49.047 --> 00:46:51.017
老兄,你的訓練不太順利 
Your training's not going well, man.

823
00:46:51.035 --> 00:46:54.009
我是說,坦白講,我覺得 你沒有盡百分百的努力 
Frankly, I don't feel like you're giving me 100 percent.

824
00:46:54.035 --> 00:46:57.013
作為你的獄前教育專家,我很擔憂 
And as your incarceration expert, that concerns me.

825
00:46:57.035 --> 00:46:59.039
因為我的工作是讓你做好獄前準備 
Because it's my job to prepare you.

826
00:47:00.052 --> 00:47:02.006
幸運的是,我有個計劃 
Fortunately, I got a plan.

827
00:47:02.023 --> 00:47:04.043
哦,感謝上帝,太好了 
Oh, thank God. Oh, that's good.

828
00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:08.014
- 你要學會如何接受口交 - 什麼?! 
- You're gonna learn how to suck dick. - What?!

829
00:47:09.049 --> 00:47:10.086
哦,上帝 
Oh, God.

830
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:13.086
聽好了,我說你要學會如何口交 
Listen up. I said I want you to learn how to suck dick.

831
00:47:14.004 --> 00:47:15.053
我聽到了! 
I heard you!

832
00:47:16.054 --> 00:47:17.086
- 這就是你的計劃? - 是的 
- That's your plan? - Yes.

833
00:47:18.004 --> 00:47:21.070
我要說的是,如果命運把這個陰莖 放進你嘴裡,你就得接受口交 
All I'm saying is that when life puts a dick in your mouth, you make dickade.

834
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:25.020
“口交”不比陰莖好聽多少 
"Dickade" doesn't sound like a significant improvement over dick.

835
00:47:25.038 --> 00:47:28.000
退一萬步講,詹姆斯! 我知道我在說什麼 
Bottom line, James! I know what I'm talking about.

836
00:47:28.017 --> 00:47:30.038
- 我們說的是活下來 - 我明白 
- We're talking about survival. - I understand.

837
00:47:30.072 --> 00:47:35.034
- 這就是你活下來的原因,對嗎? - 不,你閉嘴,不,這不是 
- Because that's how you survived. Right? - No, you shut your mouth. No, it is not.

838
00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:36.084
我靠這些活下來 
I survived with these.

839
00:47:37.056 --> 00:47:41.001
- 雙手擼絕活 - 不,不是!我用拳頭打架 
- Dual hand jobs. - No. No! I kill with these.

840
00:47:41.098 --> 00:47:46.027
這就是你和我的區別 因此你需要去做口交 
That's the difference between me and you. Hence, why you need to suck a dick.

841
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:47.064
來吧,老兄 
Come on, man.

842
00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:51.006
我要去哪裡找個人去...? 
Where am I gonna find someone who...?

- Voted "Flirtiest Brunch" three years in a row. - What do I say? What do I literally say?

847
00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:05.012
你就禮貌地說,“我想為你口交” 
You say, "I wanna suck your dick." Politely.

848
00:48:05.029 --> 00:48:09.050
嘿,嗨,我叫詹姆斯 你介意我替你吹個簫嗎? 
Hey, hi. I'm James. You mind if I could give you a little head?

- 嘿,我是詹姆斯 - 我想為你口交 
- Hey, I'm James. - I wanna suck your dick.

850
00:48:11.072 --> 00:48:13.092
- 我想為你口交 - 就是這樣!繼續! 
- I wanna suck your dick. - There you go! Just dive in!

851
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.000
- 他們就是這麼幹的 - 有人拒絕怎麼辦? 
- That's what they do. - What if someone says no?

852
00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:18.059
沒人會說不,這是客觀事實 
He ain't gonna say no. It's a scientific fact.

853
00:48:18.077 --> 00:48:19.084
誰說的? 
According to who?

854
00:48:20.002 --> 00:48:22.009
口交百科網!這有什麼關係呢? 
Dickapedia! Why do you care?

855
00:48:22.027 --> 00:48:25.093
- 這網站是真的嗎? - 不,詹姆斯,那是...站起來 
- Is that a real site? - No. James, it's a... Get up.

00:48:26.011 --> 00:48:29.043

You're gonna go to that bar. That guy. That guy right there.

857
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:33.044
站起來,去那裡,禮貌地問那個人 能否讓你口交 
Get up, go over there, and politely ask that man can you suck his dick.

858
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.044
哦,上帝,真不敢相信我要做這個 
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I'm about to do this.

859
00:48:36.066 --> 00:48:38.003

一個人吃飯? 
Eating alone?

877

你認為你能跟我在一起? 
You think that you can get with me?

- 哦,有趣的話題 - 等等,不,這不是請你坐下 
- Interesting topic of conversation. - Wait. No. That wasn't a sit-down invitation.

聽著,老兄,你會找到意中人的 
Look, you're gonna find you someone, man.

902
00:50:53.096 --> 00:50:57.004
你只是要把眼光放得實際些,懂嗎? 
You just gotta set your sights on something more realistic, you know?

903
00:50:57.026 --> 00:51:00.000
你得放長遠點,想想長遠關係 
You gotta think long-term. Think about the relationship.

904
00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:02.067
你想跟誰一起撫養那個中國寶寶?

934
00:52:25.068 --> 00:52:27.067
讓其他獄友尊重你

看看要打多少下才能蓋上 
And see how many hits it gets.

948
00:53:03.072 --> 00:53:05.046
哦,我的上帝 
- Hmm? - Oh, my God.

949
00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:08.092
希望你帶了好又多的會員卡 因為你要買一大堆陰莖棒! 
Hope you brought your Costco card, because you're about to get dick in bulk!

950
00:53:09.027 --> 00:53:11.005
什麼?太不幸了 
What? This is so dark.

951
00:53:11.023 --> 00:53:14.018
吃五道帶雞巴的菜如何? 
How does a prix fixe dinner of five courses of dick sound?

952
00:53:14.035 --> 00:53:16.030
- 你吃有機食品? - 什麼? 
- You eat organic? - What?

953
00:53:16.048 --> 00:53:20.043
一份新鮮的、熱烘烘的睪丸怎麼樣! 
How about fresh farm-to-table, a purée of my balls!

954
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:25.010
耶,陰莖節快樂,聖雞雞! 
Yeah. Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock! Hmm?

955
00:53:25.045 --> 00:53:26.073
好了,好吧,老兄 
Okay. All right, man.

956
00:53:26.091 --> 00:53:28.048
詹姆斯,這些話都是哪來的? 
Where is this stuff coming from, James?

957
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.082
嘿,小子,你讓你的父母失望了 
Hey, son. You're a disappointment to your parents.

958
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.040
他倆我都幹過! 
Who I fucked!

959
00:53:33.058 --> 00:53:34.082
哦,該死 
Oh, shit.

960
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.074
詹姆斯,這不正常 想想這個你就會發瘋 
James, this is sick. You gotta be crazy to think of this.

961
00:53:38.029 --> 00:53:39.074
這樣發瘋是好的 
That crazy is good.

962
00:53:39.092 --> 00:53:42.058
謝謝,我還有六個小時的髒話在這裡 
Thank you. I've got about six hours more.

963
00:53:42.076 --> 00:53:45.008
好,詹姆斯,很好 
That's good, James. That's really good.

964
00:53:46.026 --> 00:53:48.059
我喜歡這個,很喜歡 
I like that. I like that a lot.

我希望你帶著你的陰莖打孔卡 因為第八個是免費的 
I hope you brought your dick punch-card because the eighth dick is free.

966
00:53:53.048 --> 00:53:54.072
刺! 
Stab!

967
00:53:55.027 --> 00:53:57.014
啊,該死!好了 
Shit! Okay.

968
00:53:57.081 --> 00:53:59.010
詹姆斯,乾得不錯 
That's not bad, James.

969
00:53:59.073 --> 00:54:01.060
乾得非常棒 
That's not bad at all.

970
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:03.027
有進步 
Progress.

971
00:54:10.012 --> 00:54:13.065
彼得吹簫手挑了許多醃制的雞雞! 
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled cocks!

972
00:54:15.083 --> 00:54:16.095
不錯 
Yes.

973
00:54:17.009 --> 00:54:20.033
入獄前十天

974
00:54:23.009 --> 00:54:26.033
嘿、嘿、嘿! 準備好開始今天的工作了嗎? 
Hey, hey, hey! You ready to get to work today?

975
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.034
- 你好 - 這都是什麼玩意? 
- Hello. - What's all this stuff?

976
00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:34.009
哦,這些是刀子 
Oh, these are shanks.

977
00:54:34.027 --> 00:54:35.072
或者說“刀” 
Or "shivs."

978
00:54:35.094 --> 00:54:38.093
在蘇格蘭,人們稱其為“利器” 
In Scotland, they're referred to as "chibs."

979
00:54:40.036 --> 00:54:43.014
實際上,這個是我做給你的 
In fact, I made this one for you.

980
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:46.027
- 給我的? - 是的 
- Really? - Yeah.

981
00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:49.052
我只想說,謝謝你所做的一切 
Just to say thank you for all the hard work.

982
00:54:50.012 --> 00:54:51.015

00:54:52.092 --> 00:54:54.044
兄弟會 這很好,很酷 
That's nice. That's cool.

984
00:54:54.062 --> 00:54:59.032
哇哦,哇哦,別握著刀刃 你以前沒拿過刀嗎?握這裡 
Whoa, whoa. Don't hold it by the blade. Haven't you ever held one before? Right here.

985
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:02.070
是的,我沒拿過 我的室友以前總拿著刀 
Yeah, no, my cellie used to hold them all the time.

986
00:55:02.088 --> 00:55:04.095
我不喜歡刀,刀引起太多糾紛 
I don't like them. They cause too much trouble.

987
00:55:05.013 --> 00:55:07.075
你在操場亮出刀,會招來攻擊 他們會這麼做的 
You pull that out on the yard, somebody come out attack you, they can do this to you.

988
00:55:07.093 --> 00:55:09.096
現在你要怎麼做? 你懂我的意思嗎? 
Now what do you do? You know what I mean?

989
00:55:12.068 --> 00:55:14.080
見鬼的,這從哪來的? 
What the hell? Where'd that come from?

990
00:55:14.097 --> 00:55:16.026
我自學的屁股保護方法 
I taught myself how to keister.

991
00:55:17.035 --> 00:55:20.026
屁股保護方法?在屁股上? 
How to keister? Up the keister?

992
00:55:20.044 --> 00:55:23.043
看,這是電動牙刷的一部分 很有效 
Look, the electronic toothbrush part, it still works.

993
00:55:23.061 --> 00:55:26.014
哦,不,好了,詹姆斯,關掉它 
Oh, no. Okay, James. Cut it off.

994
00:55:26.065 --> 00:55:28.031
關掉它,老兄,拿開 
Cut it off. Get it out of my face, man.

995
00:55:28.049 --> 00:55:29.090
我不用手就能啟動它 
I can turn it on with no hands.

996
00:55:30.007 --> 00:55:32.036
我不想看這個 我不想看這個戲法 
I don't want to see that. I don't want to see that trick.

997
00:55:32.053 --> 00:55:34.036
好了,放回去,上帝啊 
It's okay. Put it back. God.

998
00:55:34.054 --> 00:55:36.024
- 放回去? - 不,不,不 
- Put it back? - No. No, no.

999
00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:38.032
停,停,停,拜託停下 
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please.

1000
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.007
- 想我教你怎麼做嗎? - 不,我想跳過這個 
- Do you want me to teach you how? - No, I'm gonna pass on that.

1001
00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:43.012
首先,呼氣 
It starts with a simple inverse inhale.

1002
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.033
詹姆斯,停下 
James, stop it.

1003
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:49.012
同時放鬆括約肌 
That, with a simultaneous relaxing of the sphincter.

1004
00:55:49.047 --> 00:55:51.000
我不想知道 
I don't wanna know.

1005
00:55:51.018 --> 00:55:52.038
你確定? 
You sure?

1006
00:55:52.055 --> 00:55:55.059
我確定,我只想問你個問題 
I'm positive. I just wanna ask you one question.

1007
00:55:55.076 --> 00:55:59.059
我在那裡,摸著所有那些刀柄 
I was over there, and I was touching all those shanks.

1008
00:55:59.098 --> 00:56:01.039
它們...? 
Were they, uh...?

1009
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:05.072
- 能放進後面? - 是,能放進去嗎? 
- Keistered? - Yeah. Were they keistered?

1010
00:56:07.036 --> 00:56:09.052
大部分,是的 
Most of them. Yeah.

1011
00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:19.032
入獄前八天

1012
00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:21.032
我們要模擬一場監獄暴亂 
We're about to simulate a prison riot.

1013
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.095
你要明白那是監獄裡最危險的時候 
Understand that this is the most dangerous situation there is.

1014
00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:26.020
囚犯害怕,獄警也害怕 
Prisoners are scared. Guards are scared.

1015
00:56:26.038 --> 00:56:29.016
活下來的關鍵是克服恐懼 
The key to surviving is to not freak out.

1016
00:56:29.034 --> 00:56:33.021
- 我的上帝,暴亂時會發生什麼? - 傑傑裡奧會向你扔些東西 
- Good Lord. What's gonna happen? - Cecelio's just gonna throw some stuff at you.

1017
00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:35.084
一些自負的人,一些骯髒的 無家可歸的傢伙,他能拿到的一切 
Some roosters, some mangly homeless guys, whatever he's got.

1018
00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:38.096
- 這讓他興奮十足 - 好的,來吧 
- He's really excited about this. - Okay. Let's do it.

1019
00:56:39.014 --> 00:56:40.059
等等,沒有防彈衣嗎? 
Wait, don't I get body armor?

1020
00:56:40.077 --> 00:56:43.005
不,我們沒那個美國時間 傑傑裡奧! 
No. We don't have that type of time. Cecelio!

1021
00:56:43.023 --> 00:56:44.076
為什麼沒有足夠時間? 
Why don't we have enough time?

1022
00:56:44.094 --> 00:56:47.006
記住,別害怕 
Remember, do not freak out.

1023
00:56:47.023 --> 00:56:48.035
燈光! 
Lights!

1024
00:56:48.053 --> 00:56:49.056
音樂! 
Music!

1025
00:56:49.074 --> 00:56:50.077
誰想參加派對?! 
Who wants to party?!

1026
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:54.036
上啊!上啊!上啊! 
Go! Go! Go!

1027
00:56:54.053 --> 00:56:56.052
傑傑裡奧!把雞放進去! 
DARNELL: Cecelio! Release the chickens!

1028
00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:58.069
不、不、不,詹姆斯!別害怕! 
No, no, no, James! Don't freak out!

1029
00:56:58.087 --> 00:57:00.044
達尼爾,那有隻狒狒! 
JAMES: Darnell, there's a baboon!

1030
00:57:01.062 --> 00:57:03.024
你現在在我的地盤! 
- DARNELL: You're in my world now! - Aah!

1031
00:57:04.033 --> 00:57:05.057
來人,放我出去! 
Someone let me out!

1032
00:57:05.075 --> 00:57:07.008
振作起來,別害怕! 
DARNELL: Stop freaking out!

1033
00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.025
漂亮! 
It's fucking beautiful!

1034
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:15.079
哦,見鬼! 
Oh, shit!

1035
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:18.005
去死!去死! 
Die! Die!

1036
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:23.047
傑傑裡奧,關掉它! 
DARNELL: Cecelio, turn it off!

1037
00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:25.026
關掉它! 
Turn it off!

1038
00:57:25.085 --> 00:57:26.093
關掉它! 
Turn it off!

1039
00:57:27.011 --> 00:57:28.064
詹姆斯,我失控了! 
James, I've lost control!

1040
00:57:28.082 --> 00:57:32.052
傑傑裡奧!退回去!我失去控制了! 
Cecelio! Pull back! I have lost control!

1041
00:57:33.061 --> 00:57:35.015
哦,我的上帝! 
Oh, my God!

1042
00:57:35.032 --> 00:57:36.065
- 啊,上帝! - 哦,我的上帝

1043
00:57:36.082 --> 00:57:37.098
見鬼!

- 我被刺了! - 不! 
- JAMES: I'm stabbed! - No!

1045

- 我被刀割了! - 不,老兄,你割傷了我! 
- JAMES: I'm cut! - No, you cut me, man!

1046
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.090
你刺傷了我! 
You stabbed me!

1047
00:57:43.008 --> 00:57:44.015
- 不,我沒有! - 不,你有! 
- No, I didn't! - Yes, you did!

1048
00:57:44.033 --> 00:57:48.012
我告訴你別害怕 你卻嚇呆了!上帝!等等! 
I told you, don't freak out! You freaked out! God! Wait...

1049
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:49.066
- 不,我很好 - 等一下 
- JAMES: No, I'm okay. - Hold up.

1050
00:57:49.084 --> 00:57:51.058
那只是紅酒而已 
JAMES: It's just the wine.

1051
00:57:51.076 --> 00:57:53.004
老兄,我看到酒精對你有什麼作用 
I see all the wine, man.

1052
00:57:53.022 --> 00:57:54.029
我感覺很好 
I totally feel fine.

- 這是一把刀,只是一把刀 - 是,我知道 
- It's a shiv. It's just a shiv. - Yes, I know.

1056
00:58:05.064 --> 00:58:06.089
嘿,別嚇壞了 
Hey, don't freak out.

1057
00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:08.010
- 我要把刀拔出來 - 好的 
- I'm gonna pull it. - Okay.

1058
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.004
DARNELL GRUNTS THEN JAMES SCREAMING

1059
00:58:14.007 --> 00:58:15.019
哦,我的老天 
Oh, my God.

1060
00:58:15.036 --> 00:58:17.098
這玩意就像魚鉤 你越往外拉,它越往裡鑽 
It's like a fishhook. The more you pull, the deeper it lodges.

1061
00:58:18.016 --> 00:58:21.057
好了,好了,聽著,我老婆是護士 我把你帶到她那去,好嗎? 
All right. Okay. Look, my wife's a nurse. Let's get you to my wife. Okay?

1062

哦,上帝,哦,我的上帝 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1064
00:58:26.054 --> 00:58:28.028
它要從我頭裡戳出來了 
It's sticking right out of my head.

1065
00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:31.095
聽著,詹姆斯,我不想再看了 我要開始... 
James, listen. I don't want to look at it no more because I'm starting to...

1066
00:58:32.013 --> 00:58:33.054
哦,該死,我太害怕了 
Oh, shit. I'm so scared.

1068
00:58:38.022 --> 00:58:40.092
- 哦,上帝! - 你弄得更深了 
- Oh, God! - You drove it in a little deeper.

00:59:14.005 --> 00:59:16.041
什麼?搞什麼? 
What? What the fuck?

1083
00:59:16.059 --> 00:59:20.067
但是別在你把我送到宿舍時哭 不然我也該哭了 
But don't start crying when you drop me off at the dorm, because then I'll start crying.

1084
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.059
我愛你,爸爸 
I love you, Dad.

1085
00:59:24.089 --> 00:59:26.055
我也愛你,夥計 
Love you too, man.

1086
00:59:27.018 --> 00:59:30.022
- 我該下車了 - 詹姆斯!不!不! 
- This is where I need to get out. - James! No! No!

1087
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.072
關門!關門! 
Close the door! Close the door!

1088
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.006
- 我們在柯契拉? - 不,詹姆斯! 
- Are we at Coachella? - No, James!

1089
00:59:40.066 --> 00:59:45.023
麗塔,再次感謝你 把我頭上的刀子取下來 
Rita, thank you once again for taking the knife out of my head.

1090
01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:04.080
瑪凱拉,怎麼...? 
RITA: Makayla, what...?

1091
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.021
小妞 
Young lady.

1092
01:00:06.039 --> 01:00:08.022
但他正在做 
But he's doing it.

1093
01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.072
這很美味 
This is delicious.

1094
01:00:11.052 --> 01:00:12.089
好了,詹姆斯,詹姆斯 
- DARNELL: Okay, James. James. - Grr.

1095
01:00:13.006 --> 01:00:15.097
停,停,你不必像這樣吃東西 你在休假 
Stop. Stop. You don't have to eat like that. You're on furlough.

1096
01:00:17.086 --> 01:00:20.056
抱歉,這是我訓練的一部分 
Sorry. It's part of my training.

1097
01:00:20.095 --> 01:00:23.061
如果你任由別人找你麻煩,不讓你 好好吃飯,你就是一個廢物 
If you let someone mess with your food, you're a punk.

1098
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:25.069
儘管這很美味 
It's delicious, though.

1099
01:00:26.045 --> 01:00:28.057
聽著,你需要立刻打住 
Look, you need to shut this stuff down right now.

1100
01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:31.099
你不知道你的所作所為會在 他入獄前就害死他嗎? 
Do you understand you're gonna get him killed before he even gets to prison?

1101
01:00:32.017 --> 01:00:34.083
- 你在說什麼? - 達尼爾表現很棒 
- What are you talking about? - Darnell's doing a wonderful job.

1102
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.083
- 他是個好老師 - 看到了? 
- He's a great teacher. - See that?

1103
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.054
也是一個很好的朋友 
And a great friend.

1104
01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:41.083
我唯一搞不懂的就是 他怎麼會進監獄的 
I just can't figure out how he ever went to jail in the first place.

1105
01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:43.033
老天,我也不知道 
RITA: Gosh, me neither.

1106
01:00:43.055 --> 01:00:47.000
達尼爾,怎麼不告訴詹姆斯 你過去是怎麼走上歧途的? 
Darnell, have you every shared with James the story of how you went away?

1107
01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.026
不,他沒有 
No, he hasn't.

1108
01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:50.047
嗯,他現在還沒準備好告訴你這些 
Well, he's not really ready for that right now.

1109
01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:52.063
瑪凱拉在這裡呢 
And I got Makayla at the table.

1110
01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:56.001
我是說,她是一個已判刑的重罪犯的 女兒,她很堅強 
I mean, she's the daughter of a convicted felon. She's strong.

1111
01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.051
- 嗯 - 說得好 
- Mm-hm. - JAMES: Good point.

1112
01:00:57.069 --> 01:01:00.081
你為什麼不講講?別省略任何細節 
Why don't you tell it? Don't leave out details.

1113
01:01:04.032 --> 01:01:07.011
我很想聽聽 我認為會對我有幫助 
I'd love to hear it. I think it could really help me.

1114
01:01:09.037 --> 01:01:10.057
好吧 
Okay, uh...

1115
01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:14.074
我們就是在街邊的混混 
We was just some boys in the hood.

1116
01:01:16.017 --> 01:01:18.049
我,我的好友,裡基和步兵 
Me, my man, Ricky, and Doughboy.

1117
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:22.008
步兵的真名是羅素 我們關係很好,夥計 
Doughboy's real name was Russell. We was close, man.

1118
01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:25.038
說到裡基,裡基很特別 因為他前途光明 
Thing about Ricky, Ricky was special, because Ricky had the ticket.

1119
01:01:25.055 --> 01:01:29.080
裡基是名出色的橄欖球四分衛 他有望直升大學 
Ricky was star quarterback. You know, he had a college future.

1120
01:01:29.097 --> 01:01:31.080
他是我們的黃金男孩,你明白嗎? 
He was our golden boy, you know?

1121
01:01:31.098 --> 01:01:35.030
我們和一些傢伙起了糾紛 你知道,幫派群毆什麼的 
We got into it with some other guys. You know, some gangbang stuff.

1122
01:01:35.048 --> 01:01:37.064
在回家的路上我們分開了 
Uh, on the way home we decide to split up.

1123
01:01:38.044 --> 01:01:40.047
我和步兵說我們走這邊 
Me and Doughboy said we'll go this way.

1124
01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:41.093
裡基說他走那邊 
Ricky said he'll go this way.

1125
01:01:42.082 --> 01:01:45.048
我和步兵轉回來,發現裡基躺在地上 
Me and Doughboy come around, we see Ricky on the ground.

1126
01:01:46.037 --> 01:01:47.073
裡基中槍了 
Ricky got shot.

1127
01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:49.078
我跑到那裡,我跑啊,跑啊 
I run over there. I'm running, I'm running.

1128
01:01:49.095 --> 01:01:53.061
我抓起他,把他的頭抱在懷裡 我看著他,哭喊,“裡基! 
I grab him. I got his head on my arm. I'm looking. I'm like, "Ricky!"

1129
01:01:55.004 --> 01:01:56.020
裡基! 
Ricky!"

1130
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.046
裡基” 
"Ricky."

1131
01:02:05.026 --> 01:02:06.054
他本前途光明啊! 
He had the ticket!

1132
01:02:07.034 --> 01:02:08.059
他們殺了他 
They got him.

1133
01:02:09.005 --> 01:02:11.088
步兵說,“來吧,兄弟,站起來 讓他去吧,他已經死了” 
Doughboy's like, "Come on, man. Get up. Let him be. He's done."

1134
01:02:12.056 --> 01:02:13.076
我站起來 
I get up.

1135
01:02:13.093 --> 01:02:17.026
步兵說,“你知道這是什麼意思 意思是我們要挺身而出” 
Doughboy says, "You know what this mean. This mean we gotta step up."

1136
01:02:17.044 --> 01:02:20.018
我說,“你說得對,就是這樣” 所以我們武了個裝 
I said, "You damn right, it does." So we strapped up.

1137
01:02:20.077 --> 01:02:23.081
- 我不知道那是什麼意思 - 我們弄到了噴子 
- I don't know what that means. - It means we got the burners.

1138
01:02:23.099 --> 01:02:25.031
我不知道那是什麼意思 
I don't know what that means.

1139
01:02:25.049 --> 01:02:28.040
我們弄到了槍 
It means we went and got the guns.

1140
01:02:29.007 --> 01:02:31.032
那晚我們發現了那些傢伙 
We saw those guys later that night.

1141
01:02:31.049 --> 01:02:33.069
三槍爆頭 
Three headshots. Pop! Pop! Pop!

1142
01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:37.053
- “這是為了裡基!” - 毫無疑問 
- "That's for Ricky!" - For sure.

1143
01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.041
警察來了,夥計 
Cops came, man.

1144
01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.095
我告訴步兵我來擔下一切 
I told Doughboy I'd take the rap.

1145
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:48.021
我說,“你快走,繼續過你的生活 我會告訴他們一切都是我做的” 
I said, "You go ahead. Live your life. I'll tell them it was me."

1146
01:02:48.076 --> 01:02:50.071
警察來了,我說,“是我做的” 
Cops came. I said, "I did it."

1147
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:52.030
我進了監獄 
I went to jail.

1148
01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:59.001
你為羅素犧牲了你的自由和人生 
You gave your life and your freedom for Russell.

1149
01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.005
忠誠如一 
Loyal to a fault.

1150
01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:04.014
事情就是這樣 
It is what it is.

1151
01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:06.039
就是我如今還在洗車的原因 
That's why I wash cars today.

1152
01:03:06.057 --> 01:03:08.002
因為我的雙手沾滿鮮血 
Because I got blood on my hands.

1153
01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.073
就像麥克白夫人一樣 
Just like Lady MacBeth.

1154
01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:12.057
像麥克白 
- - Huh? - JAMES: Like MacBeth.

1155
01:03:12.074 --> 01:03:13.078
是的 
Yes.

1156
01:03:14.095 --> 01:03:16.057
是的 
- Yes. - Phew.

1157
01:03:16.075 --> 01:03:17.099
哇,真是個好故事 
Wow, what a story.

1158
01:03:18.071 --> 01:03:20.028
聽起來簡直就像一部電影 
Almost sounds like a movie.

1159
01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.012
對啊 
RITA: Phew. Yeah.

1160
01:03:25.005 --> 01:03:29.008
達尼爾,你怎麼不告訴他 那時一位白人女士來了,收養了你... 
Darnell, why don't you tell him about that time that that white lady came and adopted you...

1161
01:03:29.026 --> 01:03:31.029
為你申訴改判為防衛過當 
and turned you into an offensive tackle.

1162
01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:34.009
我想今晚我們說的夠多了 
I think we've talked enough tonight.

1163
01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:36.013
我叫的車來了 
Oh. There's my cab.

1164
01:03:36.048 --> 01:03:40.059
我得在關門前趕回去 要不傑傑裡奧會活埋了我 
I'd better get back before lockdown or Cecelio will put me in the hole.

1165
01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:43.001
他喜歡教訓我 
He loves putting me in the hole.

1166
01:03:44.098 --> 01:03:47.035
- 我送你出去,老兄 - 不必麻煩了 
- Well, let me walk you out, man. - No, that's fine.

1167
01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:48.081
感謝你所做的一切 
Thanks for everything.

1168
01:03:48.099 --> 01:03:50.081
詹姆斯,很高興見到你 
James, it was wonderful meeting you.

1169
01:03:50.099 --> 01:03:52.011
我也很高興遇見你 
JAMES: Great to meet you too.

1170
01:03:52.049 --> 01:03:55.094
你知道,長大後,我的家人 從未像這樣聚在一起 
You know, growing up, my family would never spend any time together like this.

1171
01:03:56.037 --> 01:03:57.053
你們很幸運 
You guys are very lucky.

1172
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:02.012
- 再見,瑪凱拉 - 再見,金先生 
- Bye, Makayla. - Bye, Mr. King.

1173
01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:04.037
再見 
Bye-bye.

1174
01:04:07.038 --> 01:04:09.079
嘿,你爸爸從沒進過監獄,好嗎? 
Hey, your dad never went to jail, okay?

1175
01:04:10.043 --> 01:04:12.042
我看過《街區男孩》 
I've seen Boyz n the Hood.

1176
01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:15.021
誰給你看的《街區男孩》? 
Who showed you Boyz n the Hood?

1177
01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:17.001
爸爸,我不認為是他做的 
Daddy, I don't think he did it.

1178
01:04:17.018 --> 01:04:18.038
他當然沒有 
Of course he didn't.

1179
01:04:18.056 --> 01:04:21.013
你要做些真正能幫助到他的事 
You need to do something that's really gonna help him.

1180
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:24.010
他在監獄裡撐不了多久 
He will not last in prison.

1181
01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.031
他甚至在我的學校裡都撐不下去 
He wouldn't even last in my school.

1182
01:04:57.031 --> 01:04:58.059
你好,我是詹姆斯 
Hello, this is James.

1183
01:04:58.097 --> 01:05:01.068
嘿,是我,達尼爾 聽著,老兄,我想了想 
Hey. It's me, Darnell. Look, man, I've been thinking it over...

1184
01:05:01.085 --> 01:05:04.097
我覺得在你入獄時 給你找些額外的保護是個好主意 
and it might be a good idea to get you extra protection on the inside.

1185
01:05:05.015 --> 01:05:08.006
所以明天我們要去我的表兄弟羅素家 現在聽我說,詹姆斯 
So tomorrow we're gonna go over to my cousin Russell's house. Now listen.

1186
01:05:08.023 --> 01:05:10.048
我的表兄弟羅素和他的夥伴 是與我們完全不同的人 
DARNELL: Russell and his friends, they're different dudes.

1187
01:05:10.065 --> 01:05:12.019
對外來者很有戒心 
Very suspicious of outsiders.

1188
01:05:12.036 --> 01:05:15.052
我是說,當你走進那裡 他們很可能立刻認為你是警察 
You walking in there, they're probably gonna think you a cop off the bat.

1189
01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:19.078
所以為了避免遇到危險 我需要你做些事情 
So I need you to do something for me so we don't create any dangerous situations.

1190
01:05:19.095 --> 01:05:21.015
- 穿得更隨便些 - 把臉涂黑 
- DARNELL: Dress casually. - Blackface.

1191
01:05:21.033 --> 01:05:22.049
這是搞什麼啊?! 
What the fuck was that?!

1192
01:05:23.096 --> 01:05:25.070
- 明天見 - 詹姆斯,詹姆斯 
- See you tomorrow. - DARNELL: James. - James.

1193
01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:28.049
詹姆斯,別做蠢事,穿得隨便些 
James, don't do nothing stupid. Just dress casual.

1194
01:05:30.076 --> 01:05:31.080
入獄前七天 
HORN HONKING

1195
01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:13.071
- 行頭不錯啊 - 該死的你在幹什麼? 
- Nice whip. - What the hell are you doing?

1196
01:06:13.088 --> 01:06:16.042
- 你覺得你打扮得像誰,詹姆斯? - 李爾·韋恩 
- Who you supposed to be dressed like, James? - Little Wayne.

1197
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:19.067
- 他上一次現場秀就是這麼穿的 - 哦,李爾·韋恩 
- It's what he wore at his last runway show. - Oh, Lil Wayne.

1198
01:06:19.085 --> 01:06:24.084
你告訴我需要入鄉隨俗,所以我 熬了一整夜,研究你們的文化 
You told me I needed to try to fit in, so I stayed up all last night studying your culture.

1199
01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:27.014
- 抱歉,你說什麼? - 對於那些說爵士樂 
- I'm sorry, what? - And to those who say jazz...

1200
01:06:27.031 --> 01:06:32.043
是唯一美國本土的藝術形式 我要說,我的朋友,聽聽傑斯的歌 
is the only indigenous American art form, I say listen to a little Jay-Z, my friend.

1201
01:06:34.007 --> 01:06:36.048
我忘了杜松子酒和果汁 我是否該回家去拿呢? 
I forgot the gin and juice. Should I run back inside?

1202
01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:50.099
你能別晃了嗎? 
Will you stop?

1203
01:06:51.096 --> 01:06:54.000
我不會盜用你們的文化 
I'm not trying to appropriate your culture.

1204
01:06:54.055 --> 01:06:56.092
- 這很棒,我會告訴其他人 - 我只想說 
- That's great. I'll tell the others. - I'm just saying...

1205
01:06:57.009 --> 01:06:59.079
嘻哈是一種非常 複雜多面的亞文化... 
hip-hop is a very sophisticated, multifaceted subculture...

1206
01:06:59.097 --> 01:07:02.017
適合所有類型的人群 
that speaks to all different types of people.

1207
01:07:02.035 --> 01:07:06.030
那音樂,風尚,態度,力量... 
The music, the fashions, the attitudes, the beefs...

1208
01:07:06.048 --> 01:07:08.084
我讀得越多,聽得越多... 
The more I read, the more I listened...

1209
01:07:09.002 --> 01:07:12.076
越能接觸到其豐富的文化內涵 
the more I felt connected to its rich cultural tapestry.

1210
01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:16.023
那真是太好啦,現在,拜託我們 可以結束這番對話了嗎? 
That is really great. Now, can we please be done with this conversation?

1211
01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:18.081
別再晃了 
Please stop.

1212
01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:23.078
我想我知道是誰殺了圖帕克 
I think I know who killed Tupac.

1213
01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:33.079
- 下一個! - 搞什麼鬼? 
- JAMES: I got next! - What the fuck?

1214
01:07:34.013 --> 01:07:36.016
- 你好 - 我要給你屁股加個蓋 
- Hello. - MAN: I'm gonna put a cap in yo ass.

1215
01:07:36.072 --> 01:07:38.021
你他媽是誰?! 
Who the fuck are you?!

1216
01:07:38.038 --> 01:07:41.004
- 他沒問題,他是跟我來的 - 那你他媽是誰,黑鬼? 
- Yo, he's good. He with me. - And who the fuck are you, nigga?

1217
01:07:41.093 --> 01:07:43.055
嘿,羅素,羅素! 
Hey, Russell. Russell!

1218
01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.046
羅素 
Russell.

1219
01:07:45.064 --> 01:07:47.047
羅素!是我 
Russell! Excuse me.

1220
01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:50.018
你好,詹姆斯·金,高級基金經理 威爾索普基金管理 
JAMES: Hello. James King, Senior Fund Manager, Wealthrop Funds.

1221
01:07:50.035 --> 01:07:52.060
- 詹姆斯,快走吧 - 對不起,過一下 
- James, come on. - JAMES: Excuse me. Right through here.

1222
01:07:55.065 --> 01:08:00.031
他就是你說的那位 你要幫他做好準備進監獄的王八蛋? 
Hell no, man. Is this the motherfucker who you said you had to get ready for prison, man?

1223
01:08:02.016 --> 01:08:06.078
我需要保護,我希望能加入 克倫肖王一夥 
Well, I need protection, and I'm hoping to join the Crenshaw Kings.

1224
01:08:06.095 --> 01:08:08.019
是嗎? 
Are you? Ha-ha-ha.

1225
01:08:09.066 --> 01:08:13.091
嘿,我過去見過白人,我的緩刑監督官 就是白人,你明白我的意思嗎? 
I've seen white people before. My probation officer is white. You know what I'm saying?

1226
01:08:14.009 --> 01:08:17.008
但是你,混賬 你白得像蛋黃醬,老兄 
But you, motherfucker, man, you white as mayonnaise, man. Ha-ha-ha.

1227
01:08:20.018 --> 01:08:22.075
見鬼,也許是黑臉的蛋黃醬 誰知道呢? 
Oh, shit. Maybe in blackface. Who knows? Ha-ha-ha.

1228
01:08:24.035 --> 01:08:25.096
嘿,聽著,我來告訴你 
Hey, listen. I tell you what though.

1229
01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:28.021
老兄,你穿得倒是很對 
You damn sure got your get-up right, man.

1230
01:08:28.039 --> 01:08:32.009
我是說,迷彩和豹紋 這是明確寫在幫派手冊上的 
I mean, camouflage and cheetah print, that's straight out the gangbanger's handbook.

1231
01:08:32.077 --> 01:08:34.064
對,就像李爾·韋恩,對嗎? 
Yeah, yeah, like Lil Wayne, right?

1232
01:08:35.019 --> 01:08:36.026
正是,謝謝你 
Exactly. Thank you.

1233
01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:38.035
我喜歡這個 
MOUTHS I love it.

1234
01:08:38.057 --> 01:08:40.094
聽著,他沒打算加入我們,好嗎? 
Look, he's not trying to be a member, okay?

1235
01:08:41.011 --> 01:08:43.081
他只想你能在他入獄期間保護他 
He just wants you to protect him while he's on the inside.

1236
01:08:43.099 --> 01:08:46.069
就像達尼爾擔下罪名時你為他做的 
Like you did for Darnell when he took the rap for you.

1237
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.023
什麼? 
What?

1238
01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:52.095
這件事我們下次再談 
We can talk about that another time.

1239
01:08:53.096 --> 01:08:55.012
- 好 - 不 
- Yeah. - No.

1240
01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.062
所以繼續說下去 
So let's let that go.

1241
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.024
你記得,你知道 
You remember. You know.

1242
01:08:58.042 --> 01:09:00.091
記得裡基所做的,他的光明前途... 
With what Ricky did and the ticket...

1243
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:04.083
你嚇壞了,達尼爾控制了場面 擔下了一切 
and you freaked out and Darnell took control of the situation.

1244
01:09:05.005 --> 01:09:07.063
- 停 - 這他媽...? 
- Stop. - Is this motherfucking...?

1245
01:09:07.081 --> 01:09:09.067
《街區男孩》,老兄 
Boyz n the Hood, man.

1246
01:09:12.039 --> 01:09:14.076
- 這真不是時候 - 好吧,我告訴你,老兄 
- - This is a bad time. - RUSSELL: Okay, I tell you what, man.

1247
01:09:14.094 --> 01:09:16.026
我告訴你: 
I tell you what:

1248
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.014
來談談吧 
Humor me.

1249
01:09:18.032 --> 01:09:19.097
我是個公平的人 
I'm a fair person.

1250
01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:21.081
我是個商人 
And I'm a businessman.

1251
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.081
完全的專業人士 
Clear professional.

1252
01:09:24.061 --> 01:09:26.002
你的生活有什麼價值? 
What's your life worth to you?

1253
01:09:27.028 --> 01:09:29.057
一百萬美元聽上去怎樣? 
- How does a million dollars sound? - Ha-ha-ha.

1254
01:09:29.074 --> 01:09:31.057
“一百萬美元聽上去怎樣?” 
"How does a million dollars sound?" Ha-ha-ha.

1255
01:09:32.054 --> 01:09:34.099
大家注意,都退後 交給我來處理 
Hold up, everybody. Stand back. I'll handle it.

1256
01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:36.057
一百萬美元聽上去怎樣? 
How does a million dollars sound?

1257
01:09:36.075 --> 01:09:41.004
兄弟,一百萬美元聽上去 就像是個帶六個零數字 
Million dollars sound like a one with six zeros behind it with two commas separating them.

1258
01:09:41.021 --> 01:09:44.042
然而,大家都從有線電視新聞網上聽到 以及從華爾街日報上看到... 
However, from the sound of CNN and the looks of The Wall Street Journal...

1259
01:09:44.059 --> 01:09:48.088
只要耳不聾眼不瞎的人都得知了 你破產的消息,該死 
and everybody else with eyes and ears go to get they news, you broke, motherfucker.

1260
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:53.026
你的資產已經被凍結了 並且不會那麼快有機會被解凍 
Your assets have been frozen with no chances of thawing anytime soon.

1261
01:09:53.044 --> 01:09:55.097
所以你也就是... 
So you probably got as much or less...

1262
01:09:56.015 --> 01:09:59.051
比你身邊的那位不怎麼樣 還喜歡玩心眼兒的廢物... 
than this little no-good, manipulative, degenerate motherfucker...

1263
01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.039
強一點 
right here next to you.

1264
01:10:01.057 --> 01:10:05.002
我不得不問一下 “你懂我在說什麼嗎?” 
Which forces me to ask the question, "Are you fucking with me?"

1265
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.073
你覺得這是他媽的兒戲嗎? 你覺得我在搞笑嗎? 
You think this a motherfucking game? You think I'm playing?

1266
01:10:07.091 --> 01:10:09.090
你為什麼出現在我的地盤,我的房子裡 
Why would you come up in my hood, in my house...

1267
01:10:10.008 --> 01:10:13.061
假裝自己很有料 還承諾完全兌現不了的事? 
and present yourself as something you not, offering shit you can't deliver?

1268
01:10:13.079 --> 01:10:16.028
- 這個混賬讓你對我撒謊的嗎? - 羅素 
- Did this motherfucker tell you to lie to me? - Russ.

1269
01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:18.037
該死的閉上你的嘴吧,夥計 
Shut the fuck up, man.

1270
01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:23.000
我認為,你最好趕緊告訴我 你究竟能做什麼... 
I think, real fast, you need to tell me what the fuck you gonna do...

1271
01:10:23.017 --> 01:10:25.092
才能說服我留著你的小命 
to make me wanna keep motherfuckers off your ass.

1272
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.096
你可是在跟詹姆斯·金說話 
You're talking to James King.

1273
01:10:29.055 --> 01:10:32.059
讓我為你創造財富吧 
Let me create wealth for you.

1274
01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:39.005
所以通常最少買進 五百萬奈克斯爾基金 
So the normal minimum buy-in to the Nexel Fund is 5 million...

1275
01:10:39.023 --> 01:10:42.056
但我可以讓你們這些傢伙 用經紀商賬戶 
but I can get you guys in using a brokerage pocket account.

1276
01:10:42.073 --> 01:10:46.052
換句話說,那兩個磚頭大小的可卡因 然後把它放在這兒 
In other words, liquidate two bricks of cocaine and park it right here.

1277
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:50.094
現在隨著基金以往的業績表現 它將會在每三到五年翻一倍 
With the historical performance of the fund, that's gonna double every three to five years...

1278
01:10:51.012 --> 01:10:54.069
然後我們可以毫不費力地獲得 一百二十萬美元 
and we're looking at, mm, $1.2 million easy.

1279
01:10:54.087 --> 01:10:57.091
除了犯罪之外,才沒辦法賺那麼多錢 
Ain't no way you're making that much money without committing a crime.

1280
01:10:58.008 --> 01:10:59.049
帶著對巴爾扎克的歉意 
With apologies to Balzac.

1281
01:10:59.067 --> 01:11:01.091
你個混蛋,你在瞎扯淡什麼? 
What the fuck? You talking about my ballsack?

1282
01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:05.096
不,我們將要做的是,獲得... 
No. What we're gonna do is we get other people's money...

1283
01:11:06.013 --> 01:11:08.037
那些在市場上做出 相反預測的人的錢 
who've made an opposite prediction on the market.

1284
01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:10.096
好,我會卷起他們的錢,然後全部帶走 
Okay, we gonna roll on them and take they money.

1285
01:11:11.014 --> 01:11:13.059
那些窩囊廢有錢玩這麼大嗎? 
Just how strapped are these loser motherfuckers?

1286
01:11:13.077 --> 01:11:15.030
噢,我可不擔心 
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

1287
01:11:15.048 --> 01:11:17.051
我已經從他們那裡拿了好幾百萬了 
I've taken millions from them...

1288
01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:20.047
他們還沒有騎到我頭上來 
and they haven't stepped to me yet.

1289
01:11:21.019 --> 01:11:23.001
那些窩囊廢 
Loser motherfuckers.

1290
01:11:23.094 --> 01:11:25.085
該死的,蛋黃醬來勢洶洶哦 
Damn. Mayo is badass.

1291
01:11:26.019 --> 01:11:29.052
股市就是個黑幫 拿走你的錢讓別人沒得拿,對嗎? 
Stock market is gangster. Take what's yours and fuck the other guy, right?

1292
01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:32.052
華爾街的精英們,兄弟 那些才是真正的罪犯 
Wall Street, man. Those are the real criminals.

1293
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.069
那些傢伙殺完人還逍遙法外 
Those guys get away with murder.

1294
01:11:34.087 --> 01:11:37.099
等等,兄弟 你一直在殺人,老黑 
Wait, man. You murder people all the time, Black.

1295
01:11:38.033 --> 01:11:40.091
對,沒錯,殺人是我的最愛 
Oh, yeah. Murder's my favorite.

1296
01:11:43.017 --> 01:11:45.054
他們在想:拜託,別殺我 
And they think, "Oh, please, don't kill me."

1297
01:11:46.071 --> 01:11:49.033
我喜歡,就好像說:我不會殺你的 
I love it. And I'm like, "I'm not gonna kill you."

1298
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:52.009
他們放鬆,然後說:馬上趴在地上! 
They relax, then I'm like, "Boom, get on the ground now!

1299
01:11:52.026 --> 01:11:54.021
趴下,趴下! 
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!"

1300
01:11:54.039 --> 01:11:57.076
我要殺了你!我要殺了你! 
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1301
01:12:01.015 --> 01:12:04.064
- 我殺人上癮了 - 別擔心 
- I get excited about murder. - Don't worry about it.

1302
01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:07.031
我在笑 
I'm... I'm laughing.

1303
01:12:12.012 --> 01:12:14.048
你這次做得還湊合 
You should know, you did all right this time.

1304
01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:16.023
你的兄弟蛋黃醬是個賺錢機器 
Your boy, Mayo, is an earner.

1305
01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:18.040
你會不會給他一些 內部的幫助? 
Are you gonna get him some help on the inside?

1306
01:12:18.058 --> 01:12:19.095
我會幫他的 
I'll help him.

1307
01:12:20.012 --> 01:12:23.045
但不是我們 你知道的,內部都是有色人種 
But not with us. You know, inside it's all about color.

1308
01:12:23.063 --> 01:12:24.078
那傢伙需要加入一個白人黑幫 
Dude need a white gang.

1309
01:12:25.013 --> 01:12:26.049
非常純粹的白人黑幫 
A very white gang.

1310
01:12:27.005 --> 01:12:28.083
但我會找找關係幫他一把 
But I'll put the play together.

1311
01:12:30.005 --> 01:12:34.023
進監獄六天前

1312
01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:40.047
白人聯盟

1313
01:12:40.048 --> 01:12:41.093
我一定要加入這個黑幫嗎? 
JAMES: That's the gang I have to join?

1314
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.060
他們好像有點種族歧視 
They seem kind of racist.

1315
01:12:43.077 --> 01:12:45.060
不是有點,他們完全就是 
Ain't no "kind of." They are.

1316
01:12:45.077 --> 01:12:47.056
那是白人聯盟會 
That's the Alliance of Whites.

1317
01:12:47.073 --> 01:12:50.006
那也是你唯一 能在監獄中生存下去的機會 
That's also your only chance of survival in prison...

1318
01:12:50.024 --> 01:12:53.077
所以你需要融入他們,並且需要 讓他們確信你是他們中的一員 
so you need to go in there and you need to make them believe that you're one of them.

1319
01:12:54.028 --> 01:12:58.015
可事實上,他們叫我黑鬼 你也說來聽聽吧,自然一點 
Matter of fact, call me the N-word. But say it like you mean it, though. Let me hear it.

1320
01:12:58.062 --> 01:13:00.061
什麼?不可能 
What? No.

1321
01:13:00.087 --> 01:13:04.028
趕緊說吧,快點,詹姆斯,我現在 准許你說這個詞 
That's the wrong N-word. Come on, James, I'm giving you a free pass right now.

1322
01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:08.091
在這輛車裡,黑鬼這個詞完全沒問題 不就是個詞嘛,來吧 
In this truck, the N-word is perfectly fine. Just another word right now. Go ahead.

1323
01:13:09.021 --> 01:13:11.021
可那感覺還是不太... 
That still doesn't feel...

1324
01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:13.075
好吧,讓我們試試這個 白的反義詞是什麼? 
Let's try this. What's that place where your leg bends?

1325
01:13:14.005 --> 01:13:15.008
黑? 
My knee?

1326
01:13:15.026 --> 01:13:18.000
沒錯,那麼 跑火車的叫鐵什麼? 
Okay. And, uh, what noise does a-angry dog make?

1327
01:13:18.064 --> 01:13:20.055
- 軌? - 現在,把它們放在一起講 
- Grr? - Put it together, though.

1328
01:13:20.073 --> 01:13:22.034
黑,黑...軌 
Knee. Knee-grr.

1329
01:13:23.019 --> 01:13:24.084
該死!抱歉 
- Ow! - Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1330
01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.068
抱歉,兄弟,我情不自禁 
I am sorry, man, that just happened.

1331
01:13:28.086 --> 01:13:30.043
沒控制住自己 
That literally just happened.

1332
01:13:30.061 --> 01:13:32.039
哇哦,我給你揍得不輕 
Wow, I got you good too.

1333
01:13:32.057 --> 01:13:34.027
不知不覺就打了 
It just, like, jumped out, man.

1334
01:13:34.045 --> 01:13:36.027
就是個條件反射,真不知怎麼形容 
It was a reflex. I really can't tell you.

1335
01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:38.044
我還沒說那個詞呢 我只是說了另外兩個詞 
I didn't even say it. I was saying two other words.

1336
01:13:38.062 --> 01:13:40.040
抱歉,詹姆斯 你想讓我做什麼? 
I apologize, James. What do you want me to do?

1337
01:13:40.066 --> 01:13:43.028
趕緊下車吧 到那邊努力表現一下 
Just get your ass out the car and go in there, act hard.

1338
01:13:43.071 --> 01:13:46.003
融入他們,老兄,去吧 
Fit in, man. Go ahead.

1339
01:13:48.017 --> 01:13:49.095
把燈關掉!該死! 
Cut the light off! Shit!

1340
01:13:58.064 --> 01:13:59.067
耶! 
Fuck yeah!

1341
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.093
蜘蛛,該你了 
MAN: Spider, you're up.

1342
01:14:12.024 --> 01:14:14.002
看著學,小子 
Watch and learn, son.

1343
01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:19.061
嗨 
Hi.

1344
01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:26.082
請各位聽我講下話 我只是在找那個叫蜘蛛的人 
If I could have your attention, please. I'm just looking for Spider?

1345
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.032
他是個緝毒警! 
MAN: He's a narc!

1346
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:34.000
聽著,你不能總依著他 
Listen, this relationship can't just be built around him.

1347
01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:36.012
我的意思是,你也有權利做你開心的事 明白嗎? 
You got a right to be happy too, you know?

1348
01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:40.029
是的,聽了你的一席話 我想通了 
And I am, I am. And I think I'm open to it now because of our talk.

1349
01:14:40.047 --> 01:14:44.047
不錯,那太好了,很高興你聽進去了 很不錯 
Yeah. That's good. I love the fact that you're listening. I love that.

1350
01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:47.047
你知道嗎,我交往過的男友 都沒有你這麼好 
You know, you're the best boyfriend I never had.

1351
01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.035
好啦 
Ha, ha. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

1352
01:14:50.048 --> 01:14:53.035
好的,其實,我沒有完全放棄 還有時間 
Yeah, well, I'm not totally giving up. There is time.

1353
01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:56.019
- 事情會隨著時間的流逝而改變的 - 不,不,它們不會的 
- And things change with time. - No, no, they don't.

1354
01:14:56.036 --> 01:14:59.006
不,那永遠不會發生的 
No. No, no. That's never gonna happen.

1355
01:14:59.024 --> 01:15:02.019
- 你只是現在這麼說 - 不,我永遠都會這麼說 
- You say that now. - No, no, no. I'm always gonna say that.

1356
01:15:02.041 --> 01:15:04.024
好吧 
- Okay. - Ha-ha-ha.

1357
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.045
好的 
Okay.

1358
01:15:07.075 --> 01:15:09.003
該死 
Oh, shit.

1359
01:15:09.029 --> 01:15:11.070
嘿,我有點事,再聊嘍? 
Hey, I gotta go, okay?

1360
01:15:11.088 --> 01:15:13.045
我晚點再跟你談,玩得開心 
So I'll talk to you later. Have fun.

1361
01:15:23.022 --> 01:15:25.021
這裡是私人會所,猶太腦袋 
Private club, Jew Hair.

1362
01:15:27.035 --> 01:15:28.038
講得漂亮,蜘蛛 
Good one, Spider.

1363
01:15:29.094 --> 01:15:32.018
我就這麼走進來了 
I walked right into that one. Heh.

1364
01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:35.073
詹姆斯·金,新教教徒 
James King. Protestant.

1365
01:15:37.036 --> 01:15:41.015
肖克倫金的羅素 跟你們提到我了嗎? 
But Russell, from the Crenshaw Kings, referred me?

1366
01:15:41.032 --> 01:15:43.032
是的,羅素說了你會來的 
Yeah, Russell said you'd be by.

1367
01:15:43.049 --> 01:15:46.028
不管怎麼說,我將要進監獄了 我需要一些保護 
Anyway, I'm going to prison and I need protection.

1368
01:15:46.054 --> 01:15:48.053
好吧,那你來對地方了,大個子 
Well, welcome to the club, Jimbo.

1369
01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:50.032
太棒了!噢,上帝! 
Great! Oh, good!

1370
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.012
我們可以保護你 但是我們也有一些規則需要你來遵守 
But you get protection from us, we got rules.

1371
01:15:53.075 --> 01:15:54.099
一些原則 
Principles.

1372
01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:57.000
規則一 
Rule number one:

1373
01:15:57.038 --> 01:16:01.013
當你加入之後,就不可以 跟黑人和拉丁裔人一起勾搭 
When you're on the inside, you don't hang out with the niggers or the spics.

1374
01:16:01.064 --> 01:16:04.013
這個你能做到嗎,兄弟? 
Now, do you have a problem with that, brother?

1375
01:16:04.051 --> 01:16:05.076
我嗎? 
Me?

1376
01:16:07.043 --> 01:16:08.093
當然能 
Of course not.

1377
01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:12.093
蜘蛛,你把我看成什麼人了? 
Spider, what do you take me for?

1378
01:16:13.011 --> 01:16:15.026
我是個一流的種族主義者 
I'm a big-time racist.

1379
01:16:16.057 --> 01:16:17.093
我超討厭黑 
I hate the knee.

1380
01:16:18.011 --> 01:16:19.044
什麼? 
What?

1381
01:16:20.024 --> 01:16:21.040
那是什麼玩意? 
What is this shit?

1382
01:16:22.028 --> 01:16:26.090
我是說,我是一個典型的種族主義者 在我的棋子裡面,只有白棋 
I mean, heck, I'm such a racist that my chess set, I only have white pieces.

1383
01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.003
這麼說有點讓人糊塗,但是我不會... 
It's confusing, but I don't...

1384
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.041
我不會給黑棋任何贏的機會 
I won't give the blacks a chance to win.

1385
01:16:31.062 --> 01:16:33.024
該死 
Oh, shit.

1386
01:16:34.004 --> 01:16:35.012
他是個該死的警察 
He's a fucking cop.

1387
01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:36.074
- 他是個警察! - 我覺得不對勁 
- MAN: He's a cop! - I smell bacon.

1388
01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.054
- 我不是警察 - 最討厭那些該死的緝毒警察了 
- I'm not a cop. - Fucking hate narcs.

1389
01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:40.029
我們會追查出他究竟是幹什麼的 
We'll find out what he is.

1390
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:46.025
好的 
Yeah.

1391
01:16:48.093 --> 01:16:50.009
天啊 
Oh, God.

1392
01:16:50.027 --> 01:16:52.051
該死的,天啊 
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh, my God.

1393
01:16:56.044 --> 01:17:00.048
我只是想知道我適不適合 加入白人聯盟會而已 
I'm just wondering if maybe I'm not the best fit for the Alliance of Whites.

1394
01:17:00.065 --> 01:17:04.052
在我撕破你的臉皮之前 你有什麼需要坦白的嗎? 
You got anything to confess before I rip your face off?

1395
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:06.007
好的!來啊! 
JAMES: Fine! Go ahead!

1396
01:17:06.024 --> 01:17:09.049
殺了我吧!但是請告訴全世界我不是個賊! 
Kill me! But please tell the world I'm not a thief!

1397
01:17:09.066 --> 01:17:11.065
我並沒有做那些他們所說的事 
I did not do the things they said I did!

1398
01:17:15.092 --> 01:17:18.045
答應我,蜘蛛!答應我! 
Promise me, Spider! Promise me!

1399
01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:20.016
燒死他 
Burn him.

1400
01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.042
那是什麼鬼東西?! 
MAN: The fuck was that?!

1401
01:17:29.022 --> 01:17:30.055
沒錯 
That's right!

1402
01:17:30.073 --> 01:17:35.051
有個黑人帶著個噴火器進來了 你該知道這通常都會發生! 
A black man just came in with a flamethrower, just like you always knew would happen!

1403
01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:38.051
是的! 
Yeah!

1404
01:17:38.069 --> 01:17:40.022
惡魔降臨了,混蛋們! 
The devil in here, bitch!

1405
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.068
而且他還是個黑人 
And he's a black man.

1406
01:17:41.086 --> 01:17:44.044
給我後退!退後! 
Stay yo ass back! Stay back!

1407
01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:46.044
詹姆斯!我們走吧! 
James! Let's go!

1408
01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:47.065
好的 
Yeah.

1409
01:17:48.074 --> 01:17:50.036
- 你還好嗎? - 很好,快點吧 
- You all right? - Yeah. Come on.

1410
01:17:50.075 --> 01:17:52.057
快點,快點吧,我們走吧 
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1411
01:17:54.012 --> 01:17:57.033
知道麼?我想跟你們說點事兒 
You know what? I got something I wanna say to y'all since I'm guessing...

1412
01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:01.008
我猜這是你們第一次 被強迫聽一個黑人的話 
this is the first time that you've ever been forced to listen to a black man.

1413
01:18:01.026 --> 01:18:03.071
你知道嗎,可能你們這些傢伙 只需要冷靜點 
You know, maybe you guys should just calm the fuck down.

1414
01:18:03.088 --> 01:18:05.058
黑人不會傷害你的! 
Black people ain't trying to hurt you!

1415
01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.084
雖然我現在很有傷害力 
I mean, technically, I am right now.

1416
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:11.055
但那只是因為 你正在試圖對這位白人做的事 
But that's only because of what you were trying to do to the white guy.

1417
01:18:11.072 --> 01:18:12.076
想想這些吧! 
Think about that!

1418
01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:15.013
谷歌一下“我有一個夢想”,蠢貨們! 
Google "I Have a Dream," assholes!

1419
01:18:16.006 --> 01:18:18.030
各位,這個時刻很有教育意義 
It's a teachable moment here, people.

1420
01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:20.064
應該燒死這裡的每個人 
Should burn everybody in here.

1421
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.065
跑,詹姆斯! 
Run, James!

1422
01:18:27.053 --> 01:18:30.036
噢,該死!把他們腦袋帶到我面前來! 
- JAMES: Oh, shit! - Bring me their fucking heads!

1423
01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:32.019
跑,詹姆斯!快跑啊! 
Run, James! Run!

1424
01:18:33.033 --> 01:18:36.007
你把那輛摩托車推倒有個屁用啊? 跑啊! 
What the fuck are you knocking over the bike for?! Run!

1425
01:18:36.029 --> 01:18:39.037
噢,天啊,你就是講不出“黑鬼”啊? 
Oh, God. You just couldn't say "nigger", huh?

1426
01:18:39.054 --> 01:18:42.024
什麼?你難道還不曉得 你生我氣是諷刺在哪裡嗎? 
What?! You can't see the irony in being mad at me about that?

1427
01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:44.012
- 不! - 混賬東西! 
- - No! - WOMAN: Motherfuckers!

1428
01:18:46.059 --> 01:18:48.096
- 那是納粹的乳房! - 而且它們非常巨大! 
- It's Nazi titties! - And they're huge!

1429
01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:53.059
快跑! 
Get out!

1430
01:18:54.052 --> 01:18:55.055
該死! 
Oh, shit!

1431
01:18:55.073 --> 01:18:57.072
婊子,把你的白屁股移走! 
- WOMAN: Whoa! - DARNELL: Bitch, get your white ass off!

1432
01:18:58.019 --> 01:18:59.026
見鬼! 
Goddamn it! Ugh!

1433
01:19:00.094 --> 01:19:02.035
走吧,走吧,走吧! 
JAMES: Oh, go, go, go!

1434
01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:06.002
- 你炸了我的俱樂部,猶太腦袋 - 該死! 
- You blew up my club, Jew Hair! - Oh, shit!

1435
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.098
後種族歧視的美國,混蛋! 
JAMES: Post-racial America, assholes!

1436
01:19:08.016 --> 01:19:10.065
- 混蛋,納粹黨! - 耶! 
- DARNELL: Fuck you, Nazis! - JAMES: Yeah!

1437
01:19:15.008 --> 01:19:17.049
我很高興能回到克倫肖 這裡很安全 
JAMES: I'm so glad to be back in Crenshaw where it's safe.

1438
01:19:20.033 --> 01:19:22.079
我的一顆心現在終於落地了 
My heart is just now finally settling.

1439
01:19:22.096 --> 01:19:25.062
是啊,我們還活著 
Yeah. We're alive.

1440
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.021
讓我們共同舉杯 來慶祝逃離該死的納粹主義吧 
How about we make a toast to escaping fucking Nazis.

1441
01:19:29.039 --> 01:19:31.034
好 
Yes. Heh.

1442
01:19:37.089 --> 01:19:39.059
你真的是無辜的,是嗎? 
You really are innocent, aren't you?

1443
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:40.080
的確是! 
Yes.

1444
01:19:41.048 --> 01:19:43.064
- 當然 - 好的,詹姆斯,如果情況是這樣 
- Absolutely. - Okay, so James, if that's the case...

1445
01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:46.035
那你為什麼不試著找陷害你的傢伙? 
then why aren't you trying to find the guy that framed you?

1446
01:19:46.053 --> 01:19:48.010
我們在找 
We are.

1447
01:19:48.057 --> 01:19:49.077
誰們在找? 
Who are?

1448
01:19:50.009 --> 01:19:54.007
入獄四天前 馬丁有一調查小組 在夜以繼日調查此事 
Now, Martin has a team of investigators working around the clock.

1449
01:19:54.024 --> 01:19:57.082
他時刻讓我知道最新進展,不過一大難題是: 
He's keeping me up to date. But the million-dollar question is:

1450
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.007
- 誰偽造了我的交易記錄? - 好,跟我說說 
- Who falsified my transaction records? - All right, lay it on me.

1451
01:20:01.025 --> 01:20:03.078
好的,目前追蹤起來很複雜 
All right. Now, this is very complicated to follow.

1452
01:20:03.096 --> 01:20:07.041
我不期望你首次就能明白 所以請仔細聽好了 
I don't expect you to get it on the first pass, so listen very carefully.

1453
01:20:07.059 --> 01:20:10.008
在威爾索普基金管理上 你需要明白的一件事是... 
The one thing you need to understand at the Wealthrop Fund...

1454
01:20:10.026 --> 01:20:12.092
一切都流經馬丁之手 
is that everything flows through Martin.

1455
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.050
- 明白嗎? - 明白 
- Okay? - Okay.

1456
01:20:14.068 --> 01:20:17.034
所有與清算中心,交易者接觸的... 
Any sort of contact with the clearing house, the traders...

1457
01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:20.030
接觸交易記錄和客戶信息... 
access to trading records and client information...

1458
01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.047
國際賬戶,機構... 
international accounts, institutions...

1459
01:20:22.065 --> 01:20:27.014
當然還有佣金的發放統統流經馬丁之手 
and, of course, the doling out of commissions all goes through Martin.

1460
01:20:28.086 --> 01:20:30.069
- 所以是馬丁乾的 - 不會 
- So it's Martin. - No.

1461
01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:33.048
你不是在開玩笑吧? 詹姆斯,這是常識 
Are you fucking ki...? It's common sense, James.

1462
01:20:33.066 --> 01:20:36.078
聽著!所有箭頭都指向馬丁! 
Look! All arrows point to Martin!

1463
01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:39.070
板子上唯一的名字就是馬丁! 
The only name on the board is fucking Martin!

1464
01:20:40.008 --> 01:20:41.024
馬丁!馬丁!馬丁! 
Martin! Martin! Martin!

1465
01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.041
拜託!詹姆斯,你需要專注 
Come on! James, you need to focus.

1466
01:20:44.059 --> 01:20:47.004
你就要入獄了 除非你能證明是馬丁乾的 
You're going to prison unless you can prove that Martin did it.

1467
01:20:47.021 --> 01:20:49.008
那麼我們需要獲得一手主記錄... 
We'd need to get a hold of the master records...

1468
01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:52.004
也就是公司裡所有人的交易日誌 
which is a log of all transactions made by anyone in the firm.

1469
01:20:52.022 --> 01:20:54.088
好,我們如何獲取? 
- Okay, how do we get it? - Martin has the original copy...

1470
01:20:55.005 --> 01:20:57.080
馬丁把創立公司時的原件 存在了同一電腦上 
on the same computer that he had when he started the company.

1471
01:20:57.097 --> 01:21:00.055
你是我見過的最蠢的天才 詹姆斯,起來! 
You got to be the dumbest genius I've... Get up, James!

1472
01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:03.072
- 好的 - 去他的板子!詹姆斯,我們走! 
- All right. - Fuck the board! Let's go, James!

1473
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:05.039
我們去馬丁的辦公室 
We're going to Martin's office.

1474
01:21:12.011 --> 01:21:15.023
詹姆斯,表現得自然點 你走起路來就像你有罪一樣 
Act natural, James. You walking like you guilty.

1475
01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:17.086
- 嘿,老兄,你在看比賽? - 是的 
- Hey, big guy, you catch the game? - Yeah.

1476
01:21:18.004 --> 01:21:20.086
嘿,老兄,我叫肯 我在這兒上班 
Hey, big guy, my name is Ken. I work here.

1477
01:21:28.038 --> 01:21:29.083
它在這個櫃子裡 
WHISPERING It's in this cabinet.

1478
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:32.096
我們得想辦法把門打開 
We just have to figure out a way to get the door open.

1479
01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.058
小心 
Watch out.

1480
01:21:36.043 --> 01:21:37.042
搞定 
I got it.

1481
01:21:37.085 --> 01:21:41.055
就是這個,他創立公司時的同一台電腦 
Ugh. There it is. Same computer he had when he started the company.

1482
01:21:41.073 --> 01:21:42.076
幸運符 
It's a good luck charm.

1483
01:21:42.094 --> 01:21:44.018
幸運符個屁 
Good luck charm, my ass.

1484
01:21:44.035 --> 01:21:48.035
它與外邊世界沒有連接 沒電郵,沒互聯網,沒記錄 
It has no connection to the outside world. No emails, no Internet, no trace.

1485
01:21:49.069 --> 01:21:51.093
在這裡,主記錄 
JAMES: There it is. The master records.

1486
01:21:52.011 --> 01:21:54.073
這就是我們所需要的 這個讓我無罪開釋 
That's what we need. This will clear my name.

1487
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:56.065
好,那我們別浪費時間了 搬走吧 
Well, then let's not waste time. Get it.

1488
01:21:59.012 --> 01:22:01.074
是的!我不會入獄了 
Yes! I'm not going to prison.

1489
01:22:02.033 --> 01:22:04.045
更重要的是 我不會當任何人的替罪羊了 
More importantly, I'm not gonna be anyone's bitch.

1490
01:22:04.062 --> 01:22:06.078
嘿,朋友,你美夢成真了 
Hey, you are living the dream, my friend.

1491
01:22:07.008 --> 01:22:08.091
- 達內爾? - 什麼? 
- Darnell? - Yeah?

1492
01:22:09.009 --> 01:22:10.029
聽著,你救了我的命 
Look, you saved my life.

1493
01:22:10.071 --> 01:22:13.050
- 我不知道我以後怎麼報答你 - 哦,不用這樣 
- I don't know how I'll ever repay you. - Oh, come on, man.

1494
01:22:17.001 --> 01:22:18.017
就這一次 
Just this once.

1495
01:22:22.027 --> 01:22:23.067
好的,分開 
MAN: All right, break it up.

1496
01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:28.022
把小推車留在那裡,躲開 快點躲開,快點,躲開 
Leave the cart there and back away. Move away, come on. Move, move.

1497
01:22:29.023 --> 01:22:32.002
我尊重你的努力嘗試 但詹姆斯,夠了 
I actually respect you for trying, but enough is enough, James.

1498
01:22:32.065 --> 01:22:33.068
好吧 
All right.

1499
01:22:35.095 --> 01:22:37.035
你在做什麼? 
What are you doing?

1500
01:22:38.007 --> 01:22:39.048
詹姆斯,你在做什麼呢? 
James, what are you doing?

1501
01:22:39.066 --> 01:22:40.082
詹姆斯,別用瘋狗臉 
DARNELL: Don't mad-dog, James.

1502
01:22:43.033 --> 01:22:44.070
他要朝我們開槍 
He's gonna shoot us.

1503
01:22:45.025 --> 01:22:46.045
混蛋! 
What the fuck?!

1504
01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:48.091
不,他要殺了我們 
No. He's gonna kill us, man.

1505
01:22:49.008 --> 01:22:50.099
- 想乾架嗎?! - 哦,該死! 
- Do you want some?! - Oh, fuck!

1506
01:22:51.017 --> 01:22:52.087
- 想挑戰我?! - 噢,上帝! 
- Do you wanna step with me?! - God!

1507
01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.037
你最好...不要... 
You'd better... Don't...

1508
01:22:57.047 --> 01:22:59.000
槍,抓住槍! 
The gun! Grab the gun!

1509
01:22:59.018 --> 01:23:01.013
你為什麼不拿起槍! 
- Huh? - Why don't you pick up the gun!

1510
01:23:02.051 --> 01:23:04.005
- 拿著! - 好,我拿到了,我拿到了! 
- Grab it! - Yeah. I got it, I got it!

1511
01:23:04.052 --> 01:23:06.059
我拿到了,我拿到了 
I got it. Yeah, I got it.

1512
01:23:08.052 --> 01:23:11.014
你看上去有點緊張,第一次握槍? 
You look a little nervous. First time holding a gun?

1513
01:23:11.061 --> 01:23:12.064
不是 
Nope.

1514
01:23:13.003 --> 01:23:15.027
狗娘養的,別動! 
Motherfucker, freeze!

1515
01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:17.014
否則我崩了你! 
Before I pop yo ass!

1516
01:23:17.032 --> 01:23:18.048
“崩我”?真的嗎? 
"Pop"? Really?

1517
01:23:18.066 --> 01:23:21.023
我會聽他的 這個人是個危險的重罪犯 
I would listen to him. This man's a dangerous felon.

1518
01:23:21.045 --> 01:23:24.099
是的,除了當我查他的記錄時 那是我見過的最乾淨的記錄 
Yeah, except when I ran his record, it was the cleanest one I'd ever seen.

1519
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:26.099
甚至連一張違章罰單都沒有 
Not even a parking ticket.

1520
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:29.074
- 沒錯 - 什麼? 
- Yeah. - What?

1521
01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:32.041
你不知道?是的 
You didn't know? Yeah.

1522
01:23:32.059 --> 01:23:35.066
別瞎鬧了,給我槍 快點,給我槍 
Stop clicking around and give me the gun. Come on. Give me the gun.

1523
01:23:37.005 --> 01:23:38.054
我認為你把安全裝置打開了 
I think you have the safety on.

1524
01:23:39.009 --> 01:23:40.050
可惡! 
Shit! Ow.

1525
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:44.051
看見了吧?安全裝置打開了 
See? Safety's on.

1526
01:23:45.022 --> 01:23:46.026
安全裝置關閉 
Safety off.

1527
01:23:49.073 --> 01:23:52.022
馬丁說的對,你是個幸運的傢伙 
Martin was right. You are a lucky little shit.

1528
01:23:55.053 --> 01:23:58.027
不要再給我找到你的理由 你們都一樣 
Don't give me reason to find you again. Either of you.

1529
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:07.065
詹姆斯,不要對著我擺瘋狗臉 
Don't you mad-dog me, James.

1530
01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:11.012
聽著,聽著,詹姆斯 我得解釋解釋! 
Listen, listen, I got some explaining to do. James!

1531
01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:13.083
在我們抓住這個傢伙之後 我們可以談談這個 
We can talk about this after we go catch this guy.

1532
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.004
你這個叛徒! 
You traitor!

1533
01:24:15.021 --> 01:24:17.062
- “叛徒”? - 你教給我的一切都是騙人的! 
- "Traitor"? - Everything you taught me was a lie!

1534
01:24:18.005 --> 01:24:19.092
現在我倒霉透頂! 
And now I'm fucked beyond all fucktitude!

1535
01:24:20.009 --> 01:24:23.013
我的人生倒霉透了! 
My life's asshole is fucked!

1536
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:26.009
別滿嘴噴髒話了! 
You stop with your unorthodox style of cussing!

1537
01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:27.084
你只記住: 
You just remember:

1538
01:24:28.002 --> 01:24:31.014
不管我在監獄裡發生什麼事情 全都是你的錯! 
Whatever happens to me in there, it's your fault!

1539
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:32.085
打住吧,一派胡言 
Oh, stop. That's bullshit, man.

1540
01:24:33.002 --> 01:24:36.068
好吧,我可能在入獄這事上騙了你 但我做了該做的,我為你準備好了! 
Okay, I may have lied to you about going to jail, but I did my job. I got you ready!

1541
01:24:36.086 --> 01:24:37.089
做好什麼準備?! 
Ready for what?!

1542
01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:41.015
最扯的監獄? 
Maximum-bullshit prison?

1543
01:24:42.053 --> 01:24:44.065
因為你,我差點給別人吹了簫! 
I almost sucked a dick because of you!

1544
01:24:45.062 --> 01:24:47.003
我才不在乎 
I don't even give a shit.

1545
01:24:50.012 --> 01:24:51.091
這是我的招牌 
It's my sign.

1546
01:24:57.002 --> 01:24:59.096
入獄前兩天

1547
01:24:59.097 --> 01:25:04.067
愛爾蘭共和軍的好處就是 如果你想要錢去上學或者買房子 
Now, the great thing about an IRA, if you need the money for education or a first home...

1548
01:25:04.085 --> 01:25:07.034
那幫混蛋就撤回懲罰 
motherfuckers can make withdrawal penalty-free.

1549
01:25:07.056 --> 01:25:11.080
說實話,我分不清 羅斯和傳統個人退休賬戶 
I honestly don't get the difference between Roth and the traditional IRAs.

1550
01:25:11.098 --> 01:25:14.089
你到底怎麼回事?這個是稅前 
Fuck is wrong with you? The shit is pretax.

1551
01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:17.064
不,沒關係 很多人對此都感到很困惑 
No, it's okay. A lot of people get confused by that.

1552
01:25:17.082 --> 01:25:19.073
不,這個傢伙想惹事 讓我們接受審計 
This bitch is gonna mess around, get us audited.

1553
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:22.052
- 說說你什麼意思 - 你有存了五年的發票嗎? 
- Say what you mean. - You got five years' receipts, motherfucker?

1554
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:25.061
脫衣舞俱樂部不是家庭辦公室! 
And the strip club ain't no home office!

1555
01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.052
老黑,這是危險警告! 
That's a red flag, nigga!

1556
01:25:28.004 --> 01:25:29.049
你這個大肉球! 
You big beanbag-build bitch!

1557
01:25:30.054 --> 01:25:32.086
住手!你們都是朋友!對吧? 
Stop it! You all friends! Right?

1558
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:35.099
喬喬,你也許是對的 
Now JoJo, you might be right.

1559
01:25:36.017 --> 01:25:37.087
脫衣舞俱樂部不是家庭辦公室 
A strip club isn't a home office.

1560
01:25:38.005 --> 01:25:39.070
你在自找接受審計 
You're asking to be audited, son.

1561
01:25:40.076 --> 01:25:44.025
但有理就比友誼還重要嗎? 
But is being right more important than friendship? Huh?

1562
01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:46.034
吸取一下我的教訓吧 
Take it from me.

1563
01:25:46.064 --> 01:25:48.042
我失去了我的黑朋友 
I lost my black friend.

1564
01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.009
別失去你的 
Don't lose yours.

1565
01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:52.030
抱一下 
Hug.

1566
01:25:53.031 --> 01:25:55.039
抱一下,混蛋! 
Hug, motherfuckers!

1567
01:25:56.073 --> 01:25:58.081
- 對不起 - 對不起 
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, man.

1568
01:25:58.098 --> 01:26:02.006
- 我會永遠愛你 - 嘿,兄弟,這只是說說 
- I'll love you forever. - Hey, bro, you know, it's just talk.

1569
01:26:02.061 --> 01:26:04.044
老兄,你準備好加入幫派了? 
Say, cos, you ready to get put on the hood?

1570
01:26:04.061 --> 01:26:06.027
時刻準備著 
I'm rolling.

1571
01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:16.057
蛋黃醬,我需要你好好想想 
RUSSELL: Mayo, I need you to sink your mind into this, cos.

1572
01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:21.066
一旦你跨過這個門檻 混蛋們都會為你拼命 
Once you step through this threshold, motherfuckers are ready to kill for you.

1573
01:26:21.084 --> 01:26:25.075
我是說整個兄弟會都會全力支持你 
I mean a whole fraternity of motherfuckers gonna have your back.

1574
01:26:27.009 --> 01:26:28.096
但只有一條離開這個的路 
But there's only one way out of this.

1575
01:26:29.014 --> 01:26:31.071
那就是當你的棺材入土時 
That's when your casket drops into the ground.

1576
01:26:32.047 --> 01:26:33.072
所以從今往後... 
So from this day forward...

1577
01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:36.080
你擁有永恆的保護... 
you have eternal protection...

1578
01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.014
直到你往生 
until your eternal demise.

1579
01:26:40.044 --> 01:26:42.052
我們這幫人做事都很嚴肅 
We dead-ass serious about what we do.

1580
01:26:43.015 --> 01:26:45.098
如果你跨過這個門檻 然後回來... 
And if you go through that threshold and you make it back...

1581
01:26:46.016 --> 01:26:48.040
我們會好好地善待你 
we gonna be dead-ass serious about you.

1582
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:51.015
是時候去虐待一些混蛋了 
Time to smoke some fools.

1583
01:26:51.033 --> 01:26:53.049
一輩子都是克倫肖王的人 
Crenshaw Kings for life, motherfucker.

1584
01:26:53.075 --> 01:26:55.074
差不多了 
Hmm. Almost.

1585
01:26:56.008 --> 01:26:57.032
我們走吧 
Let's roll.

1586
01:27:00.004 --> 01:27:01.008
嘿 
SHONDA: Hey.

1587
01:27:01.046 --> 01:27:02.070
平安歸來 
You come back safe.

1588
01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:04.033
珊達,我會的 
I will, Shonda.

1589
01:27:06.009 --> 01:27:08.058
- 蛋黃醬,我們得走了 - 再見,寶貝 
- MAN: We gotta go, Mayo. - Bye, baby.

1590
01:27:08.076 --> 01:27:10.013
我們走吧 
RUSSELL: Let's roll, cos.

1591
01:27:12.068 --> 01:27:14.080
等一下!哦,該死!等等! 
Hold up! Oh, shit! Wait, wait, wait!

1592
01:27:14.098 --> 01:27:16.038
哦,等等,等等! 
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1593
01:27:16.056 --> 01:27:19.030
嘿!我是達內爾!我是達內爾! 
Hey! It's Darnell! It's Darnell!

1594
01:27:19.052 --> 01:27:22.018
- 我是達內爾! - 你在這裡幹嘛呢? 
- It's Darnell! - What the fuck are you doing here?

1595
01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.068
可惡,表弟! 告訴他們把槍放下! 
Shit, cousin! Man, tell them to put their guns down!

1596
01:27:24.086 --> 01:27:26.052
各位,放下槍吧 
Man, put them up.

1597
01:27:28.053 --> 01:27:29.056
上帝! 
DARNELL: God!

1598
01:27:29.074 --> 01:27:32.032
你怎麼回事? 你在做什麼? 
What is your problem, man? What are you doing?

1599
01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:33.069
給我們一點時間 
Man, give us a second.

1600
01:27:34.054 --> 01:27:38.007
我入會了 克倫肖王會從裡面保護我 
I'm blooding in. Crenshaw Kings are gonna protect me on the inside.

1601
01:27:38.025 --> 01:27:42.016
詹姆斯,你要去殺個人? 你已經瘋了嗎? 
So you're gonna go and kill somebody, James? Huh? Have you lost your fucking mind?

1602
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.033
我必須這麼做,我別無選擇 
I have to. I don't have a choice.

1603
01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.066
事實並非如此 
That is not true.

1604
01:27:45.084 --> 01:27:49.058
詹姆斯,我來這裡要告訴你 我們可以證明你的清白 
I came here to tell you we can clear your name, James.

1605
01:27:49.076 --> 01:27:51.029
但你得相信我 
But you gotta trust me, man.

1606
01:27:52.039 --> 01:27:53.084
蛋黃醬,我們得走了 
We gotta roll, Mayo.

1607
01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:55.030
“蛋黃醬”? 
"Mayo"?

1608
01:27:55.047 --> 01:27:58.038
- 蛋黃醬是誰? - 我是蛋黃醬,這是我的幫名 
- Who the fuck is Mayo? - I'm Mayo. It's my gang name.

1609
01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:01.051
它是“白色蛋黃醬”的縮寫 起因於我的膚色 
It's short for "Mayonnaise" on account of my skin color.

1610
01:28:01.077 --> 01:28:02.089
我想出來的 
I came up with that.

1611
01:28:03.036 --> 01:28:05.022
- 好的,那麼你要走了? - 什麼? 
- Okay, you wanna go then? - What?

1612
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.081
- 你想要走了? - 你在幹嘛呢? 
- You wanna go? - What are you doing?

1613
01:28:06.099 --> 01:28:10.010
在你的槍上印滿指紋,這樣的話,如果你進監獄 我就會跟你一塊兒進 
Putting fingerprints on your gun. If you go to jail, I'm going to jail with you.

1614
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:14.061
那麼在你入獄並做出愚蠢決定之前 為什麼不考慮一下呢? 
So before you out there and make a stupid-ass decision, why don't you think about that?

1615
01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.024
好了 
There you go.

1616
01:28:18.091 --> 01:28:21.020
就這樣?我的指紋那麼容易去掉了? 
That's it? My fingerprints are off that easy?

1617
01:28:21.038 --> 01:28:23.003
是的,差不多,完好如初 蛋黃醬,我們走吧 
Pretty much. Good as new. Let's roll, Mayo.

1618
01:28:24.046 --> 01:28:28.004
詹姆斯,現在你有了選擇 有對的路,有錯的路 
James, you got a choice right now. You got the right path, you got the wrong path.

1619
01:28:28.022 --> 01:28:29.079
詹姆斯,做出正確決定吧 
Make the right decision, James.

1620
01:28:30.009 --> 01:28:31.088
聽從你的內心 
Follow your heart, man.

1621
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:35.063
在這事上你得相信我 
James, you gotta trust me on this one.

1622
01:28:43.044 --> 01:28:47.027
哦,天哪!我差點就做了! 我差點去殺人! 
Oh, my God! I almost did it! I almost killed a man!

1623
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:49.006
我當時打算用這把槍 
And I was gonna use this gun.

1624
01:28:49.028 --> 01:28:51.094
詹姆斯,把它收起來!住手! 
James, put that away, man! Stop!

1625
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.094
- 你怎麼回事? - 我不知道 
- What is your problem? - I don't know.

1626
01:28:57.012 --> 01:28:59.090
他們在鼓動我... 
They were just encouraging me...

1627
01:29:00.008 --> 01:29:01.049
他們在對我擊掌 
and they were high-fiving me.

1628
01:29:01.079 --> 01:29:03.062
他們給了我這個大麻雪茄 
They're passing me this sticky icky.

1629
01:29:04.004 --> 01:29:06.033
在妓女和皮條客之間... 
And between the pot and the hos...

1630
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:08.070
只是一種美味的原始感覺 
it was just an ambrosia of primal sensations.

1631
01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:12.096
在一個短暫的瞬間 我知道了我的目的是什麼 
And for one brief moment, I knew what my purpose was.

1632
01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.021
- 好的,好的 - 更不用提羅素了 
- Okay, okay. - Not to mention Russell.

1633
01:29:15.039 --> 01:29:19.092
他有超凡魅力,真正天生的領導者 使我想起年輕時的羅納德·裡根 
He's so charismatic. Real natural leader. Reminds me of a young Ronald Reagan.

1634
01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:22.047
嘿... 
Hey...

1635
01:29:23.006 --> 01:29:25.001
謝謝你為我回來 
Thank you for coming back for me.

1636
01:29:27.002 --> 01:29:30.043
謝謝你沒有做傻事,我們離開這裡 
Thanks for not doing nothing stupid, man. Let's get out of here.

1637
01:29:36.002 --> 01:29:39.043
入獄前二十四小時

1638
01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:43.078
好的,聽聽這個 
All right, so listen to this.

1639
01:29:43.096 --> 01:29:46.058
我查明馬丁車上的殘渣是鹹水 
I figured out that the residue on Martin's car was saltwater.

1640
01:29:46.075 --> 01:29:50.020
然後我記起了英里數 原因在於我過去總是把里程表拍下來 
Then I remembered the mileage. I used to take a picture of the odometer all the time...

1641
01:29:50.038 --> 01:29:53.083
- 以防人們投訴我駕車兜風 - 人們會那麼幹?太糟了 
- to keep people from accusing me of joyriding. - People do that? That's awful.

1642
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:58.000
是的,你就投訴了三次,你試圖讓我被解雇 但你以為我名叫安德烈 
Yeah, you did it like three times. You tried to get me fired, but thought my name was Andre.

1643
01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:01.017
不管怎樣,看看這個: 馬丁過去每天都開一樣的七英里 
Anyway, Martin used to drive the same exact seven miles every day.

1644
01:30:01.035 --> 01:30:04.043
但上周開始,他每天開五十六英里 
But last week, he started driving 56 miles every day.

1645
01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:07.039
五十六英里!那麼我所做的是,我查了地圖 
Fifty-six! So, what I did was, I checked the map.

1646
01:30:07.056 --> 01:30:10.072
結果發現這恰是到聖佩德羅 一個來回的距離 
Turns out that's the exact distance of a round-trip to San Pedro.

1647
01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:13.048
鹹水,海洋,聖佩德羅 
Saltwater, ocean, San Pedro.

1648
01:30:13.065 --> 01:30:17.048
我必須弄清楚他為什麼去聖佩德羅 這是我唯一不明白的事情 
I just gotta figure out why he's going to San Pedro. That's the only thing I don't know.

1649
01:30:17.066 --> 01:30:19.040
他的遊艇 
His yacht.

1650
01:30:19.058 --> 01:30:20.090
它被停在了港口 
It's docked at the port.

1651
01:30:21.008 --> 01:30:23.086
- 他有遊艇? - 還有佛得角的一座島 
- Fucker's got a yacht? - Mm-hm. And an island in Cape Verde...

1652
01:30:24.004 --> 01:30:27.078
- 那裡沒有引渡法 - 詹姆斯,那廝有一艘遊艇和一座島? 
- where there are no extradition laws. - Fucker's got a yacht and a island, James?

1653
01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:30.033
混蛋在詹姆斯·邦德電影中 為大反派效命! 
Fucking working for a villain in a James Bond movie!

1654
01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.079
他就要逃跑了 
He's gonna make a run for it.

1655
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:35.000
除非蛋黃醬能阻止他 
Not if Mayo can stop him.

1656
01:30:36.051 --> 01:30:39.088
蛋黃醬和巧克力 
Mayo and Chocolat.

1657
01:30:40.006 --> 01:30:41.084
- “巧克力”? - 巧克力 
- "Chocolat"? - Chocolat.

1658
01:30:42.002 --> 01:30:45.026
- 那是我的小名嗎? - 那就是你的小名 
- Is that supposed to be my nickname? - That's your nickname.

1659
01:30:46.085 --> 01:30:49.022
我會想個更好的 車程還有一段時間呢 
I'll do better. We have the whole car ride.

1660
01:30:50.036 --> 01:30:52.052
蛋黃醬和咖啡 
Mayo and Coffee.

1661
01:30:52.069 --> 01:30:54.035
蛋黃醬和軟糖 
Mayo and Fudge.

1662
01:30:54.053 --> 01:30:57.073
- 我不想要這樣的名字,就叫我達內爾 - 來吧,軟糖! 
- DARNELL: I don't want one. Just call me Darnell. - JAMES: Hit it, Fudge!

1663
01:30:58.003 --> 01:31:05.073
入獄前二十三時 十四分四十九秒

1664
01:31:08.017 --> 01:31:11.058
就在那裡,他的船 海上通知 
There it is. There's his boat. The Sea Note.

1665
01:31:12.096 --> 01:31:15.037
海上通知?什麼玩意兒 
The Sea Note? What a dick.

1666
01:31:15.097 --> 01:31:17.046

詹姆斯,蹲下 你得蹲下 
DARNELL: Get down, James. You gotta get down.

1668
01:31:22.093 --> 01:31:24.080
- 那些都是守衛? - 我想是的 
- Are those guards? - I think so.

1669
01:31:24.098 --> 01:31:26.034
- 很多守衛 - 是的 
- DARNELL: There's a lot of them. - JAMES: Yeah.

1670
01:31:27.056 --> 01:31:28.059
那台電腦 
There's the computer.

1671
01:31:30.027 --> 01:31:31.039
我看到了 
I see it.

1672
01:31:34.044 --> 01:31:35.098
詹姆斯,你得低下身子! 
James, you gotta get low!

1673
01:31:39.004 --> 01:31:40.098
賈盧伊特馬紹爾群島

1674
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:47.007
- 哦,不,他們準備離開了 - 該死,我們得跳上船 
- JAMES: Oh, no. They're getting ready to leave. - Shit. We gotta jump.

1675
01:31:47.046 --> 01:31:48.078

鬆開我的臉! 
JAMES: Let go of my face!

1680

That sounds like a choice!

1746
01:36:25.028 --> 01:36:28.039
詹姆斯,去他的,我們走 
James, fuck him. We're leaving.

1747
01:36:28.057 --> 01:36:31.073
下次你想要存儲什麼假賬 記得找一台iPad 
And next time you wanna store some fraud shit, get an iPad.

1748
01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:32.090
快點,詹姆斯 
Come on, James.

1749
01:36:34.024 --> 01:36:36.015
- 哦,見鬼 - 艾麗莎 
- Oh, my damn. - Alissa.

1750
01:36:36.037 --> 01:36:39.086
- 詹姆斯,爸爸,他在這裡幹嘛呢? - 沒事的,親愛的 
- James. Daddy, what's he doing here? - MARTIN: It's fine, honey.

1751
01:36:40.025 --> 01:36:41.028
詹姆斯 
Uh, James.

1752
01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:45.012
我有個很棒的想法 你為什麼不跟我們來呢? 
I have a wonderful idea. Why don't you come with us?

1753
01:36:45.042 --> 01:36:49.029
我們在佛得角開始了全新的生活 沒人要進監獄 
We'll start a whole new life in Cape Verde and nobody has to go to prison.

1754
01:36:49.047 --> 01:36:50.067
難道你不想要... 
Don't you want...

1755
01:36:50.088 --> 01:36:54.050
一座大大的島? 
a big, big island?

1756
01:36:55.089 --> 01:36:58.042
- 你參與這事了? - 沒有,最初沒有 
- Were you in on this? - No, not at first.

1757
01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.068
而當他告訴我這事時 我真的很生他的氣 
And when he told me about it, I was really mad at him.

1758
01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:04.076
但後來他解釋 他如何能夠隱藏大部分錢... 
But then he explained how he was able to hide most of the money...

1759
01:37:04.094 --> 01:37:06.043
所以真的無害 
so, really, there's no harm done.

1760
01:37:06.065 --> 01:37:11.010
詹姆斯,現在還有時間 獲得你想要的一切 
James, now there's still time to get everything you want.

1761
01:37:11.078 --> 01:37:13.061
一切 
Everything.

1762
01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:16.094
不!我什麼都不想要 
No! I don't want any of it.

1763
01:37:17.095 --> 01:37:20.028
你是個白妞兒 
- And you got a white girl's ass. - Ah!

1764
01:37:20.046 --> 01:37:24.070
乾得好,嘿,詹姆斯 你想要關掉嗎?我上面什麼都沒留下 
Thattaboy. Hey, James, do you wanna switch off, man? I got nothing left up top.

1765
01:37:27.013 --> 01:37:30.062
- 快,把它扔進救生艇 - 沒錯,然後我們可以離開這裡 
- JAMES: Quick, throw it in the Zodiac. - Right. Then we can get the fuck out of here.

1766
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:35.017
可惡!該死! 
- Shit! Goddamn it! - Aah!

1767
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.080
我真誠地抱歉 事情必須這樣了結 
I am genuinely sorry it had to end this way.

1768
01:37:38.097 --> 01:37:41.030
在我們出了防波堤後,就殺了他們 
When we clear the breakwater, shoot them.

1769
01:37:41.085 --> 01:37:43.072
你不必這樣做 
You ain't got to do this, man.

1770
01:37:44.056 --> 01:37:45.097
你不必這樣做 
You ain't got to do this.

1771
01:37:46.015 --> 01:37:50.002
爸爸,似乎你想到了一切,不是嗎? 
Well, Dad, looks like you thought of everything, didn't you?

1772
01:37:50.057 --> 01:37:52.064
你總是先我一步 
You were always one step ahead of me.

1773
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:56.015
除了你忘了一個小細節 
Except you forgot one little detail.

1774
01:38:01.016 --> 01:38:02.032
哪來的? 
Where'd that come from?

1775
01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:04.049
監獄搜身第一規則: 
First rule in prison pat-downs:

1776
01:38:04.067 --> 01:38:06.070
永遠都要檢查肛門 
Always check the anus.

1777
01:38:08.017 --> 01:38:09.066
有人學會了怎麼把東西藏到屁股裡 
Someone learned how to keister.

1778
01:38:09.084 --> 01:38:13.037
沒錯,笨蛋們 
- Ew. - That's right. Nuts and butts.

1779
01:38:14.084 --> 01:38:17.009
你指我?好的 你要這樣做嗎? 
You point? Okay. That's how you wanna do it?

1780
01:38:17.026 --> 01:38:18.088
你指他,我指馬丁 
You point at him. I'll point at Martin.

1781
01:38:19.006 --> 01:38:20.084
不管怎樣,如果我死了,馬丁會死 
Either way. So if I die, Martin's going.

1782
01:38:21.002 --> 01:38:24.001
所以你搞定,殺我,馬丁會中槍 
So you figure it out. Shoot me, Martin gets shot.

1783
01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:25.084
蓋爾,現在該你採取行動了 
Ball's in your court, Gayle.

1784
01:38:26.006 --> 01:38:28.010
- 艾麗莎? - 殺了她 
- Alissa? - Shoot her.

1785
01:38:28.027 --> 01:38:30.068
殺了她,總之你要殺了那個賤人 
Shoot her. You need to shoot that bitch anyway.

1786
01:38:30.086 --> 01:38:32.002
你不會殺我的 
You're not gonna shoot me.

1787
01:38:32.036 --> 01:38:34.069
你在浪費時間,警察會隨時趕到 
You're wasting time. Police'll be here any second.

1788
01:38:34.086 --> 01:38:37.036
沒錯,我們說的是真警察 
That's right. We're talking the real police.

1789
01:38:37.053 --> 01:38:40.028
警察會開著裝有警報器的船到這兒... 
The ones that's gonna come here on boats with sirens on them...

1790
01:38:40.049 --> 01:38:42.086
會帶著會水的警犬 讓我跟你說說會水的警犬 
that's got dogs that can swim. Let me tell you something about swimming dogs.

1791
01:38:43.004 --> 01:38:45.061
我來告訴你吧,你會滿嘴跑火車 
Now, let me tell you, you're gonna bullshit a bullshitter...

1792
01:38:45.079 --> 01:38:47.074
把謊話吹得似是而非 
just make the bullshit plausible.

1793
01:38:47.092 --> 01:38:50.079
這是美國聯邦法院執行官 準備登船 
MAN: This is the U. S. Marshall Service. Prepare to be boarded.

1794
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.054
你要載著逃犯 
You are carrying a fugitive.

1795
01:38:54.005 --> 01:38:55.037
太棒了! 
Yes!

1796
01:38:55.055 --> 01:38:56.058
沒錯 
Heh. Hell yeah.

1797
01:38:56.076 --> 01:38:58.000
哦,可惡 
Oh, shit.

1798
01:38:59.022 --> 01:39:00.025
怎麼會? 
How?

1799
01:39:01.056 --> 01:39:04.038
記得你那個蹩腳律師 給我的這個腳鐐嗎? 
Remember this bracelet that crooked lawyer of yours gave me?

1800
01:39:04.056 --> 01:39:07.093
根據我的計算 我們應該正在郡界之外 
By my calculation we should be well outside the county line.

1801
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:10.089
監獄學校開學了 
Prison school's in session, bitch.

1802
01:39:11.094 --> 01:39:13.077
而有人剛剛畢業了 
And somebody just graduated.

1803
01:39:13.094 --> 01:39:15.044
太好了,太好了 
That's perfect. That's perfect.

1804
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:16.090
很棒,是嗎? 
That's great, right?

1805
01:39:17.007 --> 01:39:19.056
注意,海上通知 我們是美國聯邦法院執行官 
Attention Sea Note. This is the U.S. Marshal Service.

1806
01:39:19.074 --> 01:39:22.023
- 馬丁,你要去哪兒? - 是啊,你要去哪兒? 
- DARNELL: Where you going? Huh, Martin? - JAMES: Where you going?

1807
01:39:22.058 --> 01:39:23.090
什麼?! 
What?!

1808
01:39:24.008 --> 01:39:25.074
- 看看你! - 我知道 
- Look at you, man! - I know.

1809
01:39:25.091 --> 01:39:27.016
天哪,看看你! 
God, look at you!

1810
01:39:27.033 --> 01:39:30.078
你把它放到...?在你的屁股裡 放在你屁股裡 
Where did you put...? That was in your ass. That was in your ass.

1811
01:39:31.029 --> 01:39:33.041
電腦證明我無罪 
JAMES: The computer proved I was innocent.

1812
01:39:33.059 --> 01:39:37.062
馬丁因詐騙被捕 篡改證據和妨礙司法公正 
Martin was arrested for fraud, tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice.

1813
01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.071
我會聯繫我的律師 爸爸? 
ALISSA: And I will be contacting my attorney. Daddy?

1814
01:39:40.089 --> 01:39:44.067
至於我 我洗脫了所有與挪用公款有關的指控 
JAMES: As for me, I was cleared of all charges related to the embezzlement.

1815
01:39:44.093 --> 01:39:46.026
看來我們搞定了 
So I guess we did it.

1816
01:39:46.043 --> 01:39:48.005
蛋黃醬和巧克力 
Mayo and Chocolate.

1817
01:39:48.023 --> 01:39:51.014
感謝上帝 我們不會再需要這個了 
- Heh. - Thank God we won't be needing this anymore.

1818
01:39:51.036 --> 01:39:53.026
這把非法的未經許可的槍 
This illegal, unlicensed gun.

1819
01:39:53.044 --> 01:39:56.043
- 詹姆斯 你應該把這東西丟掉 - 槍! 
- Okay, you should really get rid of that thing. - MAN: Gun!

1820
01:39:57.003 --> 01:39:58.065
- 丟了它! - 哦,該死 
- MAN: Drop it! - Oh, shit.

1821
01:40:00.066 --> 01:40:04.007
我最後因持有未經許可的武器 被拘留六個月 
JAMES: I did end up getting six months for carrying an unlicensed weapon.

1822
01:40:06.008 --> 01:40:07.082
但多謝達內爾,我準備好了 
But, thanks to Darnell, I was ready.

1823
01:40:08.067 --> 01:40:11.062
監獄就像最純粹的生活 
Prison is like life distilled to its purest form.

1824
01:40:11.079 --> 01:40:14.066
你尊重別人,別人就尊重你 
Give respect to get respect.

1825
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:23.042
但是,如果你讓別人亂吃你的食物 那你就是娘炮 
But most of all, if you let someone fuck with your food, you're a punk fuck bitch.

1826
01:40:24.026 --> 01:40:26.084
有人應該告訴你 這個蛋黃醬過期了 
Someone should have told you this Mayo went bad.

1827
01:40:27.006 --> 01:40:28.080
老子揍死你 
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

1828
01:40:28.098 --> 01:40:30.009
老子弄死你 
I'm gonna shit you!

1829
01:40:30.027 --> 01:40:32.039
聖操蛋快樂,混蛋! 
Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!

1830
01:40:34.023 --> 01:40:37.056
馬丁準備得就不怎麼樣了 但他也汲取了寶貴的教訓 
Martin didn't do as well. But he learned a valuable lesson too.

1831
01:40:38.082 --> 01:40:41.098
他們在聖昆丁廷被搞乾翻了 
They be fucking in San Quentin.

1832
01:40:42.016 --> 01:40:44.015
- 你好嗎? - 搞乾得天翻地覆 
- How ya doing? - JAMES: A whole lot of fucking.

1833
01:40:44.033 --> 01:40:45.036
嘿!打開,打開 
Hey! Open up. Open up.

1834
01:40:50.067 --> 01:40:53.028
珊達每天來看我 
JAMES: Shonda visited me every day.

1835
01:40:54.009 --> 01:40:57.012
我從未認為監獄會是 我學著再次愛別人的地方 
I never thought prison would be the place I learned to love again...

1836
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:58.091
但這就是所發生的事 
but that's what happened.

1837
01:40:59.009 --> 01:41:02.079
不,不,不!她還沒完成,她還沒完成呢 
No, no, no! She's not done. She hasn't finished yet.

1838
01:41:03.014 --> 01:41:05.055
不,這不是你想的那樣,我們戀愛了 
No, it's not what you think. We're in love.

1839
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:10.059
我幫助聯邦調查局找到 並歸還馬丁偷走的所有資產 
JAMES: I helped the FBI find and return all the assets Martin stole.

1840
01:41:10.077 --> 01:41:15.060
作為回報,他們解凍了我的銀行賬戶 我知道把我的錢投到哪裡 
In return, they unfroze my bank accounts, and I knew just where to invest my money.

1841
01:41:17.007 --> 01:41:20.060
盛大開業

1842
01:41:24.007 --> 01:41:25.027
不錯吧? 
DARNELL: It's good?

1843
01:41:25.062 --> 01:41:26.077
很棒,是吧? 
It's good, right?

1844
01:41:26.095 --> 01:41:28.086
瑪凱拉,你為爸爸感到驕傲嗎? 
Makayla, you proud of Daddy?

1845
01:41:29.012 --> 01:41:30.095
爸爸做得很棒吧?抱我一下 
Daddy did good? Give me a hug.

1846
01:41:34.096 --> 01:41:36.099
爸爸,我喜歡你的洗車中心 
Daddy, I like your car wash.

1847
01:41:37.017 --> 01:41:39.012
寶貝,你喜歡我很高興 
I'm glad you like it, sweetie.

1848
01:41:57.048 --> 01:41:59.014
看來你倖存下來了 
I see you survived.

1849
01:41:59.032 --> 01:42:01.018
蛋黃醬,我猜你變堅強了 
I guess you got hard, Mayo.

1850
01:42:01.049 --> 01:42:03.090
不,是你讓我堅強的 
No. You made me hard.

1851
01:42:04.011 --> 01:42:06.048
過來 
Come here, man. Heh.

1852
01:42:08.012 --> 01:42:09.090
你讓我堅挺了 
You made me hard.

1853
01:42:10.066 --> 01:42:12.015
那麼堅挺 
So hard.

1854
01:42:13.071 --> 01:42:15.007
你使我如此堅挺 
You got me so hard.

1855
01:42:15.025 --> 01:42:18.008
兄弟,我也很高興見到你 我很高興見到你 
I'm happy to see you too, big fella. I'm happy to see you.

1856
01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:20.075
有段時間我不能堅挺... 
There was a moment where I stopped being hard...

1857
01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:24.025
但我想到了你 這使我再次堅挺 
but I thought of you, and it got me hard again.

1858
01:42:25.013 --> 01:42:26.083
我太感謝你了 
And I can't ever thank you.

1859
01:42:27.001 --> 01:42:28.013
好了 
All right.

1860
01:42:29.056 --> 01:42:32.042
歡迎回家 快,我們上車 
Welcome home, man. Come on, let's get in the car.

1861
01:42:32.064 --> 01:42:34.022
詹姆斯,你看起來氣色不錯

1862
01:42:39.077 --> 01:42:42.085
詹姆斯,歡迎回到自由世界 你想怎麼慶祝? 
Welcome back to the free world, James. How you wanna celebrate?

1863
01:42:43.003 --> 01:42:46.085
你知道我想要什麼嗎? 一份《華爾街日報》還有一個四十 
JAMES: You know what I'd like to get my hands on? A Wall Street Journal and a 40.

1864
01:42:47.003 --> 01:42:49.015
那會是一個完美的周日早晨 
Now that'd be a perfect Sunday morning.
