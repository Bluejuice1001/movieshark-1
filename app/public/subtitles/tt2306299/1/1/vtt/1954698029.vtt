00:13:12.413 --> 00:13:16.283
Hordes of gold and silver,
and... and a new God.

186
00:13:16.384 --> 00:13:18.285
I've heard those stories too.

187
00:13:18.386 --> 00:13:20.387
But what does it mean?

188
00:13:20.488 --> 00:13:23.990
We can't sail across
an open ocean.

189
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:25.558
I believe there's a way

190
00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:27.659
to go west.

191
00:13:30.832 --> 00:13:35.037
I have something
that will change everything.

192
00:13:36.737 --> 00:13:37.737
What?

193
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.343
What is that?

194
00:13:43.444 --> 00:13:44.544
Now just listen.

195
00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:47.614
A while back, I met someone,

196
00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:49.950
a wanderer.

197
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:51.551
He told me that it was possible

198
00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:55.255
to go west, over the open sea,

199
00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:56.690
using this.

200
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:02.395
It's a sun-board.

201
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.365
It needs to sit in water.

202
00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:07.567
Another wanderer?

203
00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:08.902
This time is different.

204
00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:11.471
<i>Rollo: Now tell me, Ragnar,
this-this wanderer of yours,</i>

205
00:14:11.572 --> 00:14:13.173
has he ever sailed
west himself?

206
00:14:13.274 --> 00:14:15.308
Just get some water.

207
00:14:16.978 --> 00:14:18.378
(Sighs heavily)

208
00:14:19.347 --> 00:14:22.282
(Water pours
and sloshes in bowl)

209
00:14:29.323 --> 00:14:31.892
<i>Ragnar:</i>
<i>Now, this candle is the sun.</i>

210
00:14:31.993 --> 00:14:33.560
Every day...

211
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:36.930
The sun rises up into the sky
until noon.

212
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:38.031
See how the shadow shortens?

213
00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:41.868
<i>At noon, it is at its shortest.</i>

214
00:14:41.969 --> 00:14:43.637
Rollo: That only tells me how
far South I have travelled.

215
00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:46.172
Didn't I just tell you
to listen?!

216
00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:49.242
<i>The day before sailing</i>

217
00:14:49.343 --> 00:14:51.678
<i>you mark a circle around</i>
<i>the pointer</i>

218
00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:55.282
where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

219
00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:57.117
The next day at sea,

220
00:14:57.218 --> 00:14:59.819
you place the board
back into water around noon

221
00:14:59.921 --> 00:15:00.854
and watch the shadow.

222
00:15:02.623 --> 00:15:05.358
<i>If the shadow only touches</i>
<i>the circle...</i>

223
00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:07.093
Your course remains true?

224
00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:08.561
Yes.

225
00:15:08.663 --> 00:15:12.532
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

226
00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:14.701
Rollo: Then you have drifted

227
00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:16.369
and you must steer
further South.

228
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.538
Yes.

229
00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:21.308
And what if it never
reaches the circle?

230
00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:22.442
<i>Rollo:</i>
<i>Then you are too far South</i>

231
00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:23.877
and must steer more
to the north.

232
00:15:23.978 --> 00:15:25.378
Ragnar: That's it!

233
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.449
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle

234
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.818
and your course will be true,

235
00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:32.919
west.

236
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.291
(Flame hisses)

237
00:15:39.293 --> 00:15:41.695
But what if there is
no sun, hmm?

238
00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:43.763
How can the board
help you then?

239
00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:46.633
How could you find your way?

240
00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:51.871
Using this.

241
00:15:56.877 --> 00:15:58.178
Follow me outside.

242
00:15:58.279 --> 00:15:59.579
(Door creaks open)

243
00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:05.618
They call it a sun-stone.

244
00:16:09.623 --> 00:16:10.957
Oh! You see?

245
00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:13.660
There is the sun.

246
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:15.428
Now we go west.

247
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.937
Come on. (Sheep bleat) Come on.

248
00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:25.075
(Loud buzz of chatter,
man clucks like a chicken)

249
00:16:28.713 --> 00:16:29.880
(Clapping)

250
00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:33.316
(Man clucks)

251
00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:36.186
(Clapping, cheering,
and laughing)

252
00:16:36.254 --> 00:16:37.988
<i>Man: Silence! (Bangs staff)</i>

253
00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:39.556
Silence! (Banging staff)

254
00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:41.291
(Everyone quiets down)

255
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.211
<i>Svein: Olaf Anwend.</i>

256
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.881
You have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

257
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:08.285
<i>Tomorrow, you will run</i>
<i>a gauntlet of stones and turf</i>

258
00:17:08.386 --> 00:17:09.586
as punishment.

259
00:17:10.955 --> 00:17:13.723
Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.

260
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.659
<i>Svein: Let it be known
a fine is to be paid</i>

261
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.095
by anyone who fails
to throw something.

262
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.565
(Crowd laughs)

263
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.735
<i>Svein:</i>
<i>Bring in the next accused.</i>

264
00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:28.738
Men: There he is! Murderer!

265
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.640
(People shout angrily)

266
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.643
Svein: Eric Trygvasson,

267
00:17:33.744 --> 00:17:37.180
you are accused of the murder
of Sigvald strut

268
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:38.315
this January.

269
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.750
How do you plead?

270
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.519
<i>Trygvasson:</i>
<i>It wasn't murder, lord.</i>

271
00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:44.221
I killed him in self-defense.

272
00:17:44.322 --> 00:17:46.756
<i>Woman: (Shouting) Liar!</i>

273
00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:47.557
Crowd: (Angry shouting)

274
00:17:47.658 --> 00:17:48.525
<i>Svein: If it wasn't murder,</i>

275
00:17:48.593 --> 00:17:49.793
<i>why did you not declare</i>
<i>your crime</i>

276
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.562
to the first person
that you met afterwards,

277
00:17:52.663 --> 00:17:54.764
<i>as the law obliges?</i>

278
00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.901
In fact, you passed by
several houses

279
00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:00.704
before you reported it.

280
00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:02.873
Trygvasson: I thought the
relatives of the dead man

281
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.207
might be living in them.

282
00:18:04.308 --> 00:18:06.843
(Crowd murmurs, disbelieving)

283
00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:09.846
<i>Svein: The law allows
you to pass two houses</i>

284
00:18:09.947 --> 00:18:11.948
in such circumstances,

285
00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:13.450
but never a third.

286
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.585
Family member: You murdered
my brother in cold blood!

287
00:18:15.653 --> 00:18:17.787
Trygvasson: It's not true!

288
00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:20.257
We argued about
some disputed land.

289
00:18:20.358 --> 00:18:21.625
He pulled out a knife.

290
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.294
Family member: You wanted
that land for yourself!

291
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.230
<i>You're a liar and a coward.</i>

292
00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:29.900
Trygvasson: Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward!

293
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:31.534
(Crowd erupts, shouting)

294
00:18:31.636 --> 00:18:32.636
Silence!

295
00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:37.274
<i>As the normal procedures</i>
<i>were not followed,</i>

296
00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:40.577
this killing cannot be
atoned for

297
00:18:40.645 --> 00:18:43.179
by compensating
the victim's family.

298
00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:47.317
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

299
00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:51.321
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

300
00:18:51.389 --> 00:18:52.789
and likely to give rise

301
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.091
to a series of revenge killings

302
00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:57.427
that would involve
your own family.

303
00:18:57.528 --> 00:19:03.433
Lord, you knew about that land.
<i>You knew I had a claim to it...</i>

304
00:19:03.534 --> 00:19:04.634
enough!

305
00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:08.872
<i>I ask you to look</i>
<i>to the accused.</i>

306
00:19:10.174 --> 00:19:12.976
If you think that he is guilty,

307
00:19:13.077 --> 00:19:14.511
raise your arms.

308
00:19:27.558 --> 00:19:29.993
The decision must be unanimous.

309
00:19:41.272 --> 00:19:42.706
Eric Trygvasson,

310
00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:46.176
<i>you have been found guilty</i>
<i>of murder.</i>

311
00:19:46.277 --> 00:19:47.911
Man: Yes! Justice!

312
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.247
How do you wish to die?

313
00:19:53.184 --> 00:19:54.951
By beheading, lord.

314
00:19:56.253 --> 00:19:58.021
Earl Haraldson:
Your wish is granted.

315
00:19:58.089 --> 00:20:00.857
You shall be executed tomorrow.

316
00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:05.562
After which we will shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

317
00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:07.630
(Crowd cheers and claps)

318
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.071
(Crowd jeers loudly)

319
00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:21.444
(Grunts)

320
00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:26.516
You have to.

321
00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:29.719
(Jeering loudly)

322
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:33.757
(Hard whack)

323
00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:36.159
Woman: Yeah! Yeah!

324
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.062
(Jeering loudly)

325
00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:43.433
(Laughing)

326
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.868
(Pained grunts)

327
00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:48.204
(Water splashes)

328
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.341
(Crowd cheers and laughs)

329
00:20:59.617 --> 00:21:01.151
(Crowd quiets down)

330
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:10.093
<i>Bjorn:</i>
<i>Why is he smiling, father?</i>

331

332
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:16.499
<i>to atone for his sins.</i>

333
00:21:26.377 --> 00:21:28.678
You must watch, for his sake.

<i>Rollo: It's his only hope

335

(Crowd quiets down)

And I curse him.

340
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.208
May he never enter Valhalla.

341
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.744
May he never feast
with the gods.

00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:03.847
(Crowd murmurs, shocked)

343
00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.785
Why did he do that?

344
00:22:08.853 --> 00:22:11.321
Ragnar: He should
not have done that.

345
00:22:11.388 --> 00:22:13.857
<i>Rollo: Someone told me he
wanted that land for himself</i>

346

and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

347
00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:17.260
but refused to sell it.

348
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.231
You hear that, boy?

00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:12.249
Earl Haraldson: Good.

365
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.517
You may put on the arm rings.

366
00:23:21.192 --> 00:23:23.193
Chieftain's wife: Come here.

367
00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:34.037
(Chuckles)

368
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:40.443
<i>Man: Wooooo!</i>

369
00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:42.879
(Crowd cheers and applauds)

370
00:23:48.686 --> 00:23:50.921
Earl Haraldson: (Sword
clanks) Let us feast!

371
00:23:51.022 --> 00:23:52.122
Ragnar: My lord,

372
00:23:53.524 --> 00:23:55.525
<i>we all want to feast,</i>

373
00:23:55.626 --> 00:23:57.093
but we also want to know

374
00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:58.428
where we will be raiding
this summer.

375
00:23:58.529 --> 00:23:59.729
(Murmurs of agreement)

376
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.164
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

377
00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:04.100
<i>Rollo: No. Tell us.</i>

378
00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:06.303
We want to know.

379
00:24:06.404 --> 00:24:08.238
We have a right to know.

380
00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:09.940
<i>Earl Haraldson: Very well.</i>

381
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.576
<i>We will raid east again,</i>
<i>to the Eastlands,</i>

382
00:24:13.678 --> 00:24:14.577
and into Russia.

383
00:24:14.679 --> 00:24:17.480
Ragnar: Every year

384
00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.683
we go to the same places!

385
00:24:23.054 --> 00:24:25.155
But there is an alternative...

386
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:27.958
(Quiet murmuring)

387
00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:29.259
If you choose.

388
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:35.665
Earl Haraldson: Oh yes, yes.
Choice, yes.

389
00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:39.502
I have heard of these rumors,
these stories;

390
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:41.471
That if we travel west,

391
00:24:41.572 --> 00:24:43.340
<i>that we will somehow</i>
<i>reach a land</i>

392
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:45.475
<i>that is rich and plentiful.</i>

393
00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:46.943
(Crowd laughs)

394
00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:51.081
But I tell you that
I will not risk my ships

395
00:24:51.182 --> 00:24:52.248
or my reputation

396
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.452
on such a deluded fantasy.

397
00:24:57.588 --> 00:25:00.256
They are my ships -
I pay for them...

398
00:25:00.358 --> 00:25:03.259
and they go where
I tell them to go.

399
00:25:03.361 --> 00:25:06.262
Now that's the end
of the matter.

400
00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:11.668
Let's feast!

401
00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:14.104
(Crowd cheers and applauds)

402
00:25:26.183 --> 00:25:28.284
<i>Ragnar: Let me see!</i>

403
00:25:29.787 --> 00:25:31.688
<i>It's a fine ring.</i>

404
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:39.496
Housecarl: Ragnar Lothbrok,

405
00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:43.066
<i>Earl Haraldson wants to</i>
<i>speak with you...</i>

406
00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:44.167
in private.

407
00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:48.972
<i>Ragnar: Stay with your Uncle.</i>

408
00:26:01.285 --> 00:26:02.685
Ragnar Lothbrok...

409
00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:07.757
Sit down.

410
00:26:13.664 --> 00:26:15.331
Are you hungry?

411
00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:18.068
Yes, lord.

412
00:26:23.107 --> 00:26:25.642
You want to feast in my hall?

413
00:26:25.743 --> 00:26:28.011
You want to sail in my ships?

414
00:26:28.112 --> 00:26:30.313
Anything else you want from me?

415
00:26:31.649 --> 00:26:32.715
Lord...

416
00:26:32.817 --> 00:26:36.019
Earl Haraldson: You keep
talking about the west...

417
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.954
what do you know of it, hmm?

418
00:26:38.956 --> 00:26:40.252
Why are you so certain

419
00:26:40.377 --> 00:26:43.311
that it's a land
of great riches, hmm?

420
00:26:43.627 --> 00:26:46.196
<i>Ragnar: I can't be sure.</i>

421
00:26:46.297 --> 00:26:47.263
But I believe that...

422
00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:50.600
I don't care what you believe.

423
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:53.236
You insulted me out there,

424
00:26:53.337 --> 00:26:56.206
and not for the first time,

425
00:26:56.307 --> 00:27:00.443
but, believe me,
it will be the last.

426
00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:10.520
<i>Svein:</i>
<i>Who told you you could go?</i>

427
00:27:16.227 --> 00:27:18.791
You are a farmer.

428
00:27:20.564 --> 00:27:22.999
You should be content
with your lot.

429
00:27:24.869 --> 00:27:27.871
Farms are few
and in great demand,

430
00:27:29.473 --> 00:27:31.307
and there are many people here

431
00:27:31.408 --> 00:27:35.044
who would like to possess
your land.

432
00:27:36.847 --> 00:27:39.182
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

433
00:27:41.218 --> 00:27:42.519
I understand.

434
00:27:44.088 --> 00:27:47.590
Then don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

435
00:28:02.072 --> 00:28:05.233
I don't trust him. Watch him.

436
00:28:09.436 --> 00:28:11.237
(Panting)

437
00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:17.877
<i>Earl Haraldson: Where are they?</i>

438
00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:19.445
Where are my sons?

439
00:28:19.513 --> 00:28:21.781
You said you'd found them.

440
00:28:27.988 --> 00:28:30.022
(Cries out in grief and pain)

441
00:28:30.123 --> 00:28:33.526
(Gasps awake,
tries to catch his breath)

442
00:28:44.437 --> 00:28:45.437
(Sighs)

443
00:29:06.293 --> 00:29:09.428
<i>Bjorn: Where are we going now?
I'm so tired.</i>

444
00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:12.665
<i>Ragnar: To talk to the gods.</i>

445
00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:14.200
It's what we do.

446
00:29:25.212 --> 00:29:28.214
Seer: Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.

447
00:29:34.387 --> 00:29:35.688
Sit.

448
00:29:41.228 --> 00:29:43.529
Ancient seer: What do you want?

449
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.633
Ragnar: I want to know what
the gods have in store.

450
00:29:47.734 --> 00:29:48.634
<i>Ancient seer: For you...</i>

451
00:29:48.735 --> 00:29:50.636
Or for the boy?

452
00:29:51.738 --> 00:29:54.373
I'm more interested in myself.

453
00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:58.177
The gods desire you
to have a great future.

454
00:29:58.278 --> 00:29:59.712
I see that.

455
00:30:00.914 --> 00:30:02.548
But they can withdraw
their goodwill

456
00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:03.649
at any time.

457
00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:08.454
<i>Ragnar:</i>
<i>To have this great future,</i>

458
00:30:08.555 --> 00:30:10.656
must I challenge the law?

459
00:30:10.724 --> 00:30:15.527
Ancient seer: You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

460
00:30:17.097 --> 00:30:19.164
so they work in your favor.

461
00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:22.868
But the laws of men

462
00:30:22.969 --> 00:30:27.339
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

463
00:30:30.043 --> 00:30:33.545
So I should take
the laws of men

464
00:30:33.613 --> 00:30:35.614
into my own hands?

465
00:30:39.619 --> 00:30:41.220
Answer me.

466
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:43.689
You already have your answer.

467
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.790
No I don't.

468
00:30:47.227 --> 00:30:50.329
<i>Ancient seer: Well, then go
and ask the gods yourself.</i>

469
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.331
What are you afraid of?

470
00:30:59.973 --> 00:31:01.573
<i>Ragnar: Wait outside.</i>

471
00:31:01.675 --> 00:31:04.009
<i>Bjorn: All right.</i>

472
00:31:04.077 --> 00:31:07.112
You haven't helped me at all,
ancient one.

473
00:31:10.984 --> 00:31:13.619
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

474
00:31:25.498 --> 00:31:26.865
(Wind gusts)

475
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.071
(Rain patters lightly)

476
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:35.541
Ragnar: We have someone
special to visit.

477
00:31:35.642 --> 00:31:37.710
His name is Floki.

478
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:39.244
<i>Bjorn: Floki?</i>

479
00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:40.813
Like loki the God?

480
00:31:42.082 --> 00:31:44.516
Ragnar: Yes, only different.

481
00:31:45.618 --> 00:31:47.519
How is he different?

482
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.954
He's not a God.

483
00:31:49.956 --> 00:31:52.558
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

484
00:31:52.625 --> 00:31:54.426
Because...

485
00:31:55.428 --> 00:31:56.528
Because he's shy.

486
00:31:57.797 --> 00:31:59.798
(Man shrieks and laughs)

487
00:32:03.603 --> 00:32:04.903
<i>Ragnar: Floki,</i>

488
00:32:04.971 --> 00:32:07.172
this is my son, Bjorn.

489
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.540
<i>Floki: Hello.</i>

490
00:32:08.608 --> 00:32:10.209
How are you?

491
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.611
Well. Thank you, sir.

492
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.980
Let me see.

493
00:32:17.217 --> 00:32:18.250
Ah!

494
00:32:18.752 --> 00:32:21.520
You have your father's eyes...

495
00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:23.188
Unfortunately.

496
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.225
Ragnar: Why unfortunately?

497
00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:28.527
It means he will be like you,

498
00:32:28.628 --> 00:32:31.363
and therefore he will want
to do better than you,

499
00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:32.831
and you will hate him for it.

500
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:34.833
(Laughs)

501
00:32:36.302 --> 00:32:39.104
Bjorn: How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

502
00:32:39.172 --> 00:32:41.340
Oh, it's the same with trees.

503
00:32:41.441 --> 00:32:43.909
I can tell which trees
will make the best planks

504
00:32:43.977 --> 00:32:46.245
just by looking at them.

505
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:49.269
I can look inside the tree.

506
00:32:50.717 --> 00:32:52.684
<i>Ragnar:</i>
<i>Floki is a boat-builder...</i>

507
00:32:52.786 --> 00:32:54.053
Among other things.

508
00:32:55.055 --> 00:32:56.055
(Laughs)

509
00:33:03.963 --> 00:33:06.031
(Woodpecker pecks nearby)

510
00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:22.915
Hmm...

511
00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:27.286
This is one.

512
00:33:28.755 --> 00:33:31.557
Inside this tree are two
almost perfect planks.

513
00:33:31.658 --> 00:33:34.159
They will bend, then curve,

514
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.160
like a woman's body

515
00:33:35.261 --> 00:33:36.662
from the thighs to the back.

516
00:33:36.763 --> 00:33:40.165
When I split this tree
I will find them.

517
00:33:42.469 --> 00:33:43.635
You can see that?

518
00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:48.740
Do you think I'm joking?

519
00:33:59.853 --> 00:34:02.187
I joke about many things,

520
00:34:02.288 --> 00:34:04.189
son of Ragnar,

521
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.758
but never about ship-building.

522
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.864
Do you imagine ships
are just dead things?

523
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:14.366
<i>Ragnar:</i>
<i>So... what about our boat?</i>

524
00:34:15.902 --> 00:34:17.369
(Waterfall roars)

525
00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:21.440
<i>Floki: It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.</i>

526
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:22.975
The construction is different.

527
00:34:23.076 --> 00:34:25.043
It's built with
a strong central plank.

528
00:34:25.111 --> 00:34:26.245
The two strakes above it
are nailed

529
00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:28.080
directly onto the knees
of the frame.

530
00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:30.149
But the ones below - look!...

531
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.650
are cleated and lashed
onto the frames,

532
00:34:31.751 --> 00:34:32.751
not nailed,

533
00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:35.220
so they can move in relation
to each other.

534
00:34:35.288 --> 00:34:37.823
This means the boat won't butt
against the waves like a goat,

535
00:34:37.924 --> 00:34:39.958
but move over them
like a ripple.

536
00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:41.426
Hmm.

537
00:34:41.528 --> 00:34:43.629
<i>Ragnar: The hull is deeper. How
will my men set their oars?</i>

538
00:34:43.696 --> 00:34:45.597
<i>Floki: I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,</i>

539
00:34:45.698 --> 00:34:48.000
<i>and the ports can be closed</i>
<i>when the boat is at sea.</i>

540
00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:50.102
And you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

541
00:34:50.203 --> 00:34:53.605
Floki: (Laughs) That's
why I'm building it.

542
00:34:55.975 --> 00:34:58.877
But will it be strong enough?

543
00:34:58.978 --> 00:35:01.613
We won't know that
until we try.

544
00:35:03.516 --> 00:35:05.884
<i>Ragnar: For the anchor.</i>

545
00:35:05.952 --> 00:35:09.188
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

546
00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:10.923
Don't worry.

547
00:35:11.024 --> 00:35:13.792
We'll soon be as rich
as dwarves!

548
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860
(Chuckles)

549
00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:25.184
I missed you.

550
00:35:33.761 --> 00:35:35.995
<i>Did anything happen</i>
<i>while we were away?</i>

551
00:35:39.066 --> 00:35:40.166
No.

552
00:35:40.267 --> 00:35:41.667
<i>Ragnar: Hmm.</i>

553
00:35:41.769 --> 00:35:42.702
(Sighs heavily)

554
00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:47.206
(Laughs) Did you miss me?

555
00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:55.048
I ached with love longing.

556
00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:59.485
My belly was empty of laughter.

557
00:36:00.921 --> 00:36:03.589
Is that what you want? Hmm?

558
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:10.530
You want me to make you laugh?

559
00:36:11.532 --> 00:36:13.733
I don't want to laugh now.

560
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.038
I want to ride you,
like a bull.

561
00:36:24.912 --> 00:36:26.045
Like a wild bull.

562
00:36:28.549 --> 00:36:29.549
(Moaning)

563
00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:35.154
(Water laps at the shore)

564
00:36:42.663 --> 00:36:46.065
(Water splashes
as rollo trudges to shore)

565
00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:52.572
(Sighs)

566
00:36:53.707 --> 00:36:55.641
Hello, young Bjorn.

567
00:36:55.742 --> 00:36:57.376
Hello, rollo.

568
00:36:57.478 --> 00:36:59.679
Where are your parents?

569
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.781
They are having sex.

570
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.651
(Chuckles) Well, uh...

571
00:37:08.722 --> 00:37:11.124
I guess we'll have to wait.

572
00:37:24.671 --> 00:37:26.272
So, Gyda,

573
00:37:27.274 --> 00:37:30.009
is your mother teaching you
<i>how to use a shield?</i>

574
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.412
Yes, I know how
to use a shield.

575
00:37:33.514 --> 00:37:36.015
Your mother was a famous
shield-maiden.

576
00:37:36.116 --> 00:37:37.016
<i>Lagertha: Was?</i>

577
00:37:37.117 --> 00:37:39.852
Rollo:
Is a famous shield-maiden.

578
00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:41.053
<i>Lagertha: Come on,
children, to bed.</i>

579
00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:41.988
<i>Gyda: Do I have to?</i>

580
00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:43.289
Let's leave the men.

581
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.791
Bjorn: But I'm a man.
I have a ring.

582
00:37:45.893 --> 00:37:47.527
<i>Ragnar: Let him stay awhile.</i>

583
00:37:47.628 --> 00:37:48.628
To bed!

584
00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.399
<i>Say good night.</i>

585
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.034
Good night, my children.

586
00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:57.036
(Children bid good night
to Ragnar and rollo)

587
00:37:57.137 --> 00:37:58.037
Good night.

588
00:37:58.138 --> 00:37:59.138
<i>Ragnar: Hey!</i>

589
00:38:02.042 --> 00:38:03.676
(Playfully) Shhhaaaaaa!

590
00:38:04.678 --> 00:38:05.678
(Laughs)

591
00:38:13.153 --> 00:38:15.188
Tell me your news.

592
00:38:15.289 --> 00:38:17.290
What about the boat?

593
00:38:17.391 --> 00:38:19.125
It's nearly ready.

594
00:38:21.328 --> 00:38:24.330
I won't go under your command.

595
00:38:26.233 --> 00:38:29.635
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

596
00:38:29.736 --> 00:38:32.138
<i>Ragnar: We are brothers.</i>

597
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.309
You and I will always be equal.

598
00:38:42.282 --> 00:38:44.750
Then we must find a crew.

599
00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:49.622
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

600
00:38:49.723 --> 00:38:51.524
Many will be afraid,

601
00:38:52.793 --> 00:38:56.195
some may even go to him
and betray us.

602
00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:00.132
I must go piss.

603
00:39:04.805 --> 00:39:06.872
(Water laps at the shore)

604
00:39:14.414 --> 00:39:15.181
(Sighs)

605
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.033
(Water pours)

606
00:39:34.134 --> 00:39:36.102
Rollo: Yesterday, I was
with a girl from the town.

607
00:39:36.203 --> 00:39:37.270
Thank you.

608
00:39:38.272 --> 00:39:40.273
A good-looking girl too.

609
00:39:45.746 --> 00:39:49.649
But when she shouted out
in pleasure,

610
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.184
I didn't see,

611
00:39:54.254 --> 00:39:55.888
I saw yours.

612
00:39:58.558 --> 00:39:59.892
Lagertha...

613
00:40:01.428 --> 00:40:03.429
Don't talk like that.

614
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.197
<i>Rollo: Why not?</i>

615
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.102
I think about you all the time.

616
00:40:10.203 --> 00:40:12.104
That's too bad.

617
00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:16.542
Rollo: Don't insult
me, shield-maiden.

618
00:40:16.643 --> 00:40:17.710
No.

619
00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:20.179
I would never insult you.

620
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.181
You're too great a warrior...

621
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:28.921
But perhaps not so great a man.

622
00:40:33.627 --> 00:40:36.262
(Waves lap at the shore,
raven caws)

623
00:40:37.964 --> 00:40:39.965
(Waves lap at the shore)

624
00:40:41.601 --> 00:40:43.202
(Wings beat loudly)

625
00:40:44.438 --> 00:40:48.574
(Ravens caw in the distance)

626
00:40:55.482 --> 00:40:58.484
(Raven caws echo loudly)

627
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.024
(Door bursts open)

628
00:41:05.125 --> 00:41:06.859
Ragnar: I saw something.

629
00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:09.128
What did you see?

630
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.063
(Exhales)

631
00:41:11.164 --> 00:41:12.164
A sign.

632
00:41:14.601 --> 00:41:18.504
It made me certain
we're doing the right thing.

633
00:41:25.512 --> 00:41:26.812
Good night, brother.

634
00:41:32.252 --> 00:41:34.253
(Bird chirps in the distance)

635
00:41:35.856 --> 00:41:38.257
(Waves lap against the ship)

636
00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.261
<i>(Water churns as they row)</i>

637
00:41:43.263 --> 00:41:44.997
<i>(Grunts of effort)</i>

638
00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:47.666
Ragnar: Set the sail.

639
00:41:49.336 --> 00:41:51.170
Floki! The sail!

640
00:41:52.672 --> 00:41:53.572
She'll sink.

641
00:41:53.673 --> 00:41:54.940
Ragnar: No she bloody won't!

642
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:58.244
<i>Floki: I shouldn't have
pretended to build such a boat.</i>

643
00:41:58.345 --> 00:42:00.646
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

644
00:42:01.648 --> 00:42:04.116
(Oar thumps) I'll set the sail.

645
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:05.918
Floki I'm sorry, Ragnar.

646
00:42:06.019 --> 00:42:08.421
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

647
00:42:08.522 --> 00:42:10.523
<i>Ragnar: Shut up, man.</i>

648
00:42:14.194 --> 00:42:15.394
(Sail unfurls)

649
00:42:21.601 --> 00:42:23.602
(Wind gusts strongly)

650
00:42:27.274 --> 00:42:28.374
(Sail snaps open,
catching the wind)

651
00:42:32.946 --> 00:42:34.380
Ha!

652
00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:42.121
Now it runs on its cool keel.

653
00:42:42.222 --> 00:42:43.989
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

654
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.991
Why didn't you believe me?

655
00:42:46.092 --> 00:42:47.793
I told you I could do it!

656
00:42:47.894 --> 00:42:49.895
(Ragnar and Floki laugh)

657
00:42:51.331 --> 00:42:52.264
<i>Ah?</i>

658
00:42:52.365 --> 00:42:55.434
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
