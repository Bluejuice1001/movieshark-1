2
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,673
Ragnar!

3
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,308
<i>Odin!</i>

4
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,574
Ragnar!

5
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,677
Come on. Let's go home.

6
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,548
Watch.

7
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,649
What are you two doing?

8
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,692
I'm taking Bjorn to the thing tomorrow.

9
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:35,590
Not yet. He's not old enough.

10
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,464
He's 12 years old.

11
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,594
Take him next year.

12
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,665
Next year is soon enough.

13
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,831
He'll need a silk ribbon, Lagertha.

14
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,375
You're a handsome boy.

15
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,476
Funny ears, though.

16
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,025
Don't sleep with lots of women in Kattegat.

17
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,957
I can do without it for a few days.

18
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,832
Is that another way of saying you love me?

19
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,799
I always dream of you.

20
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,942
Last night, I dreamt
you were feeding me blood pudding.

21
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,373
What does that mean?

22
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,777
It means you're giving me your heart.

23
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,891
Get your dog, boy.

24
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,161
Frodi! Come on, boy.

25
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,144
What will happen at the thing?

26
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:03,448
The Earl will deal with some criminal offenses,

27
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,854
and then, we'll discuss the summer raids.

28
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,484
And where will you go?

29
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:10,489
The Earl decides.

30
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,619
He owns the ships.

31
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,624
He'll send us to the east,

32
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,396
as always, to the Baltic lands,

33
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,430
but I want to know what's to the west.

34
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,405
What cities and gods are over there.

35
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,077
See, I'm not satisfied

36
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,638
with this.

37
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,716
Odin gave his eye to acquire knowledge,

38
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,285
but I would give far more.

39
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,725
And will Earl Haraldson let you?

40
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,629
Good.

41
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,508
Like this, nice and tight.

42
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,473
And on three.

43
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,748
One, two, three.

44
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,347
Very good, Gyda.

45
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,127
Gyda, feed the goats.

46
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:20,422
Go on!

47
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,130
What do you want?

48
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,431
We know you're all alone here.

49
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,803
All the men are gone.

50
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,971
If you're thirsty, I will give you a drink.

51
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,408
If you're hungry, I will feed you.

52
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,844
Otherwise, you must go.

53
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:42,184
We will eat and drink
after we've satisfied our other needs.

54
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,225
I don't want to kill you, woman.

55
00:08:56,668 --> 00:09:00,001
You couldn't kill me
if you tried for 100 years.

56
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:20,386
Out!

57
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,897
I went to confess my love to her,

58
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,231
but I was set upon by a bear

59
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:36,570
and an enormous hound
who guarded her home.

60
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:40,774
I killed the bear with my spear,

61
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,411
and I managed to strangle the hound
with my bare hands.

62
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:51,344
And that is how I gained
her hand in marriage.

63
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,257
Did she tell you the same story?

64
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,396
Just about.

65
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,972
Are you ready to receive your arm ring
and become a man?

66
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,807
Yes.

67
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:14,344
And what does a man do?

68
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,845
He fights.

69
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,341
And?

70
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,884
He looks after his family.

71
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,221
That's right.

72
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,056
Could you look after our family?

73
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,288
What do you mean?
You look after us.

74
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,958
Say I wasn't there.

75
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,698
I have a big decision to make.

76
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,801
It may change many things.

77
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:49,980
Now, go to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

78
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,663
Bjorn!

79
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,706
So, here you are, brother.

80
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,302
Rollo.

81
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,503
By Freyr and all the gods,
how you've grown.

82
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:28,739
Hello, Rollo.

83
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:31,907
Are you here for the thing?
You're a real man now.

84
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,318
Come, let's get a drink.

85
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,587
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.

86
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,625
Why don't you go lie down?

87
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:58,569
So where do you think the Earl
is going to send us this year?

88
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,569
Those bastards to the east
are as poor as we are.

89
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,944
I know.

90
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,117
That's why we should sail west.

91
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,586
I've heard such tales, Rollo.

92
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,557
Great towns and cities and treasures.

93
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:18,062
Hoards of gold and silver,
and a new god.

94
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:21,824
I've heard those stories, too,
but what does it mean?

95
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,526
We can't sail across an open ocean.

96
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,471
I believe there's a way to go west.

97
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:36,973
I have something that will change everything.

98
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:39,841
What?

99
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,457
- What is that?
- Now just listen.

100
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,851
A while back, I met someone,

101
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,193
a wanderer.

102
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,588
He told me it was possible to go west,

103
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,457
over the open sea,

104
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,901
using this.

105
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,274
It's a sun board.

106
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,538
It needs to sit in water.

107
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,637
Another wanderer?

108
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:10,974
This time, it's different.

109
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,745
Now tell me, Ragnar,
this wanderer of yours,

110
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,479
has he ever sailed west himself?

111
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,111
Just get some water.

112
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,463
Now, this candle is the sun.

113
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,969
Every day, the sun rises up
into the sky until noon.

114
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,738
See how the shadow shortens?

115
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,070
At noon, it is at its shortest.

116
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,843
That only tells me
how far south I have traveled.

117
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,283
Didn't I just tell you to listen?

118
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,884
The day before sailing,
you mark a circle around the pointer

119
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,722
where the shadow is at its shortest at noon.

120
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:58,627
The next day at sea,

121
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,960
you place the board back into water
around noon

122
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,466
and watch the shadow.

123
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,404
If the shadow only touches the circle...

124
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:08,970
Your course remains true?

125
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,365
Yes.

126
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,873
And if it passes outside the circle, like this...

127
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,806
Then you have drifted,
and you must steer further south.

128
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,077
Yes.

129
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,882
And what if it never reaches the circle?

130
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,114
Then you are too far south,
and must steer more to the north.

131
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,680
That's it!

132
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,926
Keep the noon shadow on the circle,

133
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,725
and your course will be true.

134
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,356
West.

135
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:43,198
But what if there is no sun?

136
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,435
How can the board help you then?

137
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,574
How could you find your way?

138
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,645
Using this.

139
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,257
Follow me outside.

140
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,494
They call it a sunstone.

141
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,963
You see?

142
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,805
There is the sun.

143
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:17,807
Now we go west.

144
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:24,041
Come on. Come on.

145
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:41,491
Silence!

146
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,797
Silence!

147
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:08,218
Olaf Anwend, you have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

148
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,991
Tomorrow, you will run a gauntlet of stones

149
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,087
and turf as punishment.

150
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:17,096
Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

151
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,602
Let it be known, a fine is to be paid

152
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,902
by anyone who fails to throw something.

153
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,044
Bring in the next accused.

154
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,173
- There he is!
- Murderer!

155
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:33,906
Burn him!

156
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:38,820
Eric Trygvasson, you are accused of the murder

157
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,121
of Sigvald Strut this January.

158
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:44,286
How do you plead?

159
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:47,456
It wasn't murder, Lord.
I killed him in self-defense.

160
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,227
Liar!

161
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:52,029
If it wasn't murder,

162
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,627
why did you not declare your crime

163
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,070
to the first person that you met afterwards,

164
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,165
as the law obliges?

165
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:04,181
In fact, you passed by several houses
before you reported it.

166
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:07,684
I thought the relatives of the dead man
might be living in them.

167
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:15,382
The law allows you to pass two houses,
in such circumstances,

168
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,059
but never a third.

169
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:19,153
You murdered my brother in cold blood!

170
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,255
It's not true!

171
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:25,393
We argued about some disputed land.
He pulled out a knife!

172
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,563
You wanted that land for yourself!

173
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,906
You're a liar and a coward.

174
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,842
Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward.

175
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,278
Silence!

176
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:40,543
As the normal procedures were not followed,

177
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,410
this killing cannot be atoned for

178
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,520
by compensating the victim's family.

179
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:50,583
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

180
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:54,628
Carried out in secret, unacknowledged,

181
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,531
and likely to give rise
to a series of revenge killings

182
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,538
that would involve your own family.

183
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,237
Lord, you knew about that land.

184
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:07,869
- You knew I had a claim to it...
- Enough!

185
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:12,175
I ask you to look to the accused.

186
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,481
If you think that he is guilty,

187
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:17,952
raise your arms.

188
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,801
The decision must be unanimous.

189
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,314
Eric Trygvasson,

190
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,649
you have been found guilty of murder.

191
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,818
- Yes!
- Justice!

192
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,181
How do you wish to die?

193
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,525
By beheading, Lord.

194
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:03,599
Your wish is granted.
You shall be executed tomorrow.

195
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:09,036
After which we shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

196
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,484
You have to.

197
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,497
Why is he smiling, Father?

198
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:17,035
He wants to die well, without fear,

199
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,571
to atone for his sins.

200
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,787
You must watch, for his sake.

201
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,226
It's his only hope of reaching Valhalla.

202
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,703
Feed him to your pigs!

203
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:58,979
And I curse him.

204
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,809
May he never enter Valhalla.

205
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:05,381
May he never feast with the gods.

206
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,125
Why did he do that?

207
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,187
He should not have done that.

208
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,326
Someone told me he wanted
that land for himself,

209
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:19,232
and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

210
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,429
but refused to sell it.

211
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,808
You hear that, boy?
This is how things are done around here.

212
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,346
Olaf, son of Ingolf,

213
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,552
Bjorn, son of Ragnar,

214
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,347
may you accept this gift of salt and earth

215
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:46,358
to remind yourself that you belong
to both the land and the sea.

216
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:59,572
These arm rings bind you in loyalty to me,
your lord, your chieftain.

217
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:04,640
Any oath that you swear on these rings
must be honored and kept.

218
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,079
Do you understand and swear to this?

219
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,550
- Yes, Lord.
- Yes, Lord.

220
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,819
And do you freely give your fealty to me,
your lord, your chieftain?

221
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,614
- Yes, Lord.
- Yes, Lord.

222
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:20,625
Good. You may put on the arm rings.

223
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,762
Come here.

224
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,364
Let us feast!

225
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,762
My Lord,

226
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,734
we all want to feast,

227
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:05,005
but we also want to know
where we will be raiding this summer.

228
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,775
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

229
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:09,544
No. Tell us.

230
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:11,546
We want to know.

231
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,443
We have a right to know.

232
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:15,380
Very well.

233
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:20,415
We will raid east again,
to the eastlands and into Russia.

234
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:21,991
Every year

235
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,089
we go to the same places!

236
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,061
But there is an alternative,

237
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:34,860
if you choose.

238
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,144
Yes, yes. Choice, yes.

239
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,510
I have heard of these rumors, these stories.

240
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:49,314
That if we travel west,
that we will somehow reach a land

241
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:51,286
that is rich and plentiful.

242
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:58,625
But I tell you that I will not risk
my ships or my reputation

243
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,189
on such a deluded fantasy.

244
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,928
They are my ships. I pay for them.

245
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,831
And they go where I tell them to go.

246
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,367
Now that's the end of the matter.

247
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,677
Let's feast!

248
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:33,387
Let me see!

249
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,358
It's a fine ring.

250
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,272
Ragnar Lothbrok,

251
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,110
Earl Haraldson wants to speak
with you in private.

252
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:54,575
Stay with your uncle.

253
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,131
Ragnar Lothbrok.

254
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:13,864
Sit down.

255
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,441
Are you hungry?

256
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,211
Yes, Lord.

257
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,144
You want to feast in my hall?

258
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,580
You want to sail in my ships?

259
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:35,955
Anything else you want from me?

260
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:38,552
Lord...

261
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:41,359
You keep talking about the west.

262
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,062
What do you know of it?

263
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:48,795
Why are you so certain
that it's a land of great riches?

264
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,072
I can't be sure.

265
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,434
But I believe that...

266
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:54,874
I don't care what you believe.

267
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,511
You insulted me out there,

268
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,441
and not for the first time,

269
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:06,117
but, believe me, it will be the last.

270
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,687
Who told you you could go?

271
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,733
You are a farmer.

272
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:28,902
You should be content with your lot.

273
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,741
Farms are few and in great demand,

274
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,547
and there are many people here

275
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,112
who would like to possess your land.

276
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,351
Do you understand what I'm saying?

277
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:48,354
I understand.

278
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:53,865
Then don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

279
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:10,782
I don't trust him. Watch him.

280
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,029
Where are they?

281
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,031
Where are my sons?

282
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,171
You said you'd found them.

283
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:17,248
Where are we going now?
I'm so tired.

284
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,752
To talk to the gods.

285
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,158
It's what we do.

286
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,570
Why don't you come in? I'm waiting.

287
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:43,406
Sit.

288
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,676
What do you want?

289
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,150
I want to know what the gods have in store.

290
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,385
For you, or for the boy?

291
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,190
I'm more interested in myself.

292
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,466
The gods desire you to have a great future.
I see that.

293
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:12,364
But they can withdraw their goodwill
at any time.

294
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,778
To have this great future,

295
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,209
must I challenge the law?

296
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:23,542
You must convince the gods to alter the runes

297
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,253
so they work in your favor.

298
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:30,186
But the laws of men

299
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:35,121
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

300
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,630
So I should take the laws of men

301
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,097
into my own hands?

302
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:48,711
Answer me.

303
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,206
You already have your answer.

304
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,915
No, I don't.

305
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:58,316
Well, then go and ask the gods yourself.

306
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,379
What are you afraid of?

307
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,329
Wait outside.

308
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,661
All right.

309
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:15,129
You haven't helped me at all, ancient one.

310
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,234
Perhaps you asked the wrong questions.

311
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:43,223
We have someone special to visit.

312
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,335
His name is Floki.

313
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:46,494
"Floki"?

314
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:49,038
Like Loki, the god?

315
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:52,673
Yes, only different.

316
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:55,208
How is he different?

317
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,837
He's not a god.

318
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:00,344
Why didn't he come to the thing?

319
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,748
Because...

320
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,744
Because he's shy.

321
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:14,455
Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.

322
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,663
Hello. How are you?

323
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,396
Well. Thank you, sir.

324
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:22,932
Let me see.

325
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,974
You have your father's eyes

326
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,173
unfortunately.

327
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:33,877
Why unfortunately?

328
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,344
It means he will be like you,

329
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,184
and therefore he will want
to do better than you,

330
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:41,247
and you will hate him for it.

331
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:47,163
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

332
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,221
It's the same with trees.

333
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,164
I can tell which trees will make

334
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,668
the best planks just by looking at them.

335
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:57,296
I can look inside the tree.

336
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,509
Floki is a boat-builder.

337
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,538
Among other things.

338
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,510
This is one.

339
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,547
Inside this tree are two almost perfect planks.

340
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,880
They will bend, then curve,

341
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,580
like a woman's body
from the thighs to the back.

342
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:48,351
When I split this tree,
I will find them.

343
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:52,327
You can see that?

344
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,757
Do you think I'm joking?

345
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:12,340
I joke about many things,
son of Ragnar,

346
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,782
but never about ship-building.

347
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,052
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?

348
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,918
So, what about our boat?

349
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,495
It will be lighter and carry a bigger sail.

350
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,931
The construction is different.

351
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:32,969
It's built with a strong central plank.

352
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,663
The two strakes above it are nailed

353
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,000
directly onto the knees of the frame.

354
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,041
But the ones below... Look!

355
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,872
Are cleated and lashed onto the frames,
not nailed,

356
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:43,037
so they can move in relation to each other.

357
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:46,139
This means the boat won't butt
against the waves like a goat,

358
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,945
but move over them like a ripple.

359
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:51,711
The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?

360
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,688
I will cut them into the sheerstrakes,

361
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,987
and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.

362
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,093
And you think it could handle long sea voyages?

363
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,789
That's why I'm building it.

364
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,126
But will it be strong enough?

365
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:09,030
We won't know that until we try.

366
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,142
For the anchor.

367
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:17,146
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

368
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,681
Don't worry.

369
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,917
We'll soon be as rich as dwarves!

370
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,161
I missed you.

371
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:46,170
Did anything happen while we were away?

372
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,040
No.

373
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:57,085
Did you miss me?

374
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,192
I ached with love longing.

375
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:09,390
My belly was empty of laughter.

376
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,129
Is that what you want?

377
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,370
You want me to make you laugh?

378
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:23,539
I don't want to laugh now.

379
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:28,678
I want to ride you,

380
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,280
like a bull.

381
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,788
Like a wild bull.

382
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,316
Hello, young Bjorn.

383
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:07,256
Hello, Rollo.

384
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,723
Where are your parents?

385
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,618
They are having sex.

386
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:16,822
Well...

387
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,531
I guess we'll have to wait.

388
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,449
So, Gyda,

389
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,779
is your mother teaching you
how to use a shield?

390
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:42,256
Yes, I know how to use a shield.

391
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,354
Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.

392
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,751
Was?

393
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,162
Is a famous shield-maiden.

394
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,826
- Come on, children, to bed.
- Do I have to?

395
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,163
Let's leave the men.

396
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:55,261
But I'm a man. I have a ring.

397
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:57,536
Let him stay awhile.

398
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:58,938
To bed!

399
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:03,211
Say good night.

400
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,747
Good night, my children.

401
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,609
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:07,980
- Good night.
- Good night.

403
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,313
Hey!

404
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:20,920
Good night, Father.

405
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,695
Tell me your news.

406
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:26,759
What about the boat?

407
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,999
It's nearly ready.

408
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,102
I won't go under your command.

409
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,580
I won't go unless we're all equal.

410
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:41,382
We are brothers.

411
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:45,652
You and I will always be equal.

412
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:54,059
Then we must find a crew.

413
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:57,724
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

414
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,399
Many will be afraid.

415
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:05,803
Some may even go to him and betray us.

416
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,607
I must go piss.

417
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:46,040
Yesterday, I was with a girl from the town.

418
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:47,105
Thank you.

419
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,849
A good-looking girl, too.

420
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,949
But when she shouted out in pleasure,

421
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:01,593
I didn't see her face.

422
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,830
I saw yours.

423
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,635
Lagertha...

424
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,138
Don't talk like that.

425
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:14,537
Why not?

426
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,948
I think about you all the time.

427
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,945
That's too bad.

428
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,844
Don't insult me, shield-maiden.

429
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:27,617
No.

430
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,988
I would never insult you.

431
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,550
You're too great a warrior,

432
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,091
but perhaps not so great a man.

433
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,495
I saw something.

434
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,971
What did you see?

435
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,111
A sign.

436
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:27,211
It made me certain
we're doing the right thing.

437
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,119
Good night, brother.

438
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,645
Set the sail.

439
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,614
Floki! The sail!

440
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,613
She'll sink.

441
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,119
No, she bloody won't.

442
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:08,021
I shouldn't have pretended
to build such a boat.

443
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:10,421
It's beyond my humble capabilities.

444
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:13,492
I'll set the sail.

445
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:15,457
I'm sorry, Ragnar.

446
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,263
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

447
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:20,063
Shut up, man.

448
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,726
Now it runs on its cool keel.

449
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,300
It's beautiful.

450
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:57,805
Why didn't you believe me?
I told you I could do it!

451
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:06,075
Now it's all up to you, Ragnar Lothbrok.

451
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:13,744
